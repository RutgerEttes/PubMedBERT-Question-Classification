FAML	4 year old is out of control	my 4 year old is a nightmare. me and my husband work full time, so in the morning he has to go to school. he never wants to get dressed, we fight with him every morning and it is so hard to get to work on time every day!    the morning starts with screaming fits and its awful.    he will start slamming doors, throwing things. he looks for things to throw. he breaks everything!    we have to bribe him with toys to go to school and that barely works anymore. he is just so stubborn.    he just thinks he is a king and everyone should bow to him.    he is like a ticking time bomb. he can be good then just snap in an instance. i think he has mental issues. he gets so bad that my husband has to hold him down while he is throwing his tantrums. this has been going on for over a year now. he is just a difficult child, very demanding. everyone says he is a normal 4 year old but i beg to differ. please help!    even my husband says he is normal for his age. we are so stressed all the time that we cant wait for him to grow up!!!!

FAML	Can IQ drop significantly?	"My son was diagnosed with PDDNOS at 5, then ADHD at 7, then back to PDDNOS with ADHD as a comorbid condition at 10 years. He has been having seizures since he was 3. He has    speech/language delay, poor attention, poor social thinking and limited interests and he struggles with reading.         He is better at math. He simply can't plan and start a project, remember the details and complete the task. He is in a partially mainstreamed special education program.    He is 10 years old now. He has had 3 grandmals so far and about 2-3 complex partial seizure episides per year.He    has taken IQ tests at 5 years and at 7 years    from the school and from neuropsycologists. All 4 tests revealed    below average - range ( around 87 ) for intelligence and mild impairment for executive/cognitive skills.He did pretty well in school for the last two years. He was bright and happy to participate. He had started blooming really well. His meds were changed in April to get better seizure control. We got seizure control but the side effects were bad. It feels as if his ASD and ADHD issues have worsened.    The school year had barely started, they administered a series of tests including Kaufman assesment battery for children - 2nd edition.First of all, It takes him 15 minutes to just sit and start working on a problem he knows how to do. It takes him a lot more time to warm up to a new unpredictable situation    and give his undivided attention. On top of it, he is not good at responding to    open ended questions due to his communication problems.     he is better at multiple choice questions and visual questions.When I expressed all these concerns, the district said it was just a routine test.Anyways, they say that his IQ has dropped to 60.    The only thing that has changed since the last test was that     he was hospitalized from a grand mal    2 years back, which was treated immediately and no long-term issues cropped up from that. It was confirmed by a series of medical tests.I have 3 questions. 1. Given the    list of issues (attention, language, ASD and low motivation) my son has, has the school administered the    right IQ test ?    2. Can IQ drop so significantly?     3. Are there alternate IQ tests for kids with ASD and ADHD?Also, Should I just take the IQ test results with a grain of salt and continue working with him as usual? My only worry is that his already low bar at school will be lowered even more. His teacher has already stopped sending him to science and art classes because he can't ""handle"" them. He had started enjoying learning about sea animals. She just wants to work on his reading and math goals.Sorry about the lengthy post."
GOAL	Glaucoma	"Hi,Couple of months back i went to see an OD. He told me that i might have glaucoma. From that day i lost of sleep. I was not able to do any work properly. Always thinking that my life will be dark. Then one of my friend    told me to make an appointment in ""Wills eye institute"" in PA. So, i did that and i got an appointment after one month. Then i went there and two doctors checked my eye more than 2 hrs and did lots of tests and took some picture of my eye with some laser etc and then they said nothing to worry..just do a regular eye check up yearly. Then i came back home. What next...Can i trust them and go back to my normal life or do    i need to see some body else?Thanks for your help."

GOAL	can temporary crown on upper molar cause pain in teeth below, around?	I had a tooth prepared for a crown last week. It was the upper molar, furthest back ( i don't have my wisdom teeth). I wasn't able to chew on the temporary crown even four or five days later. Then I started experiencing throbbing pain in the lower teeth, not the one directly below the tooth with the temporary crown, but the two further forward. I have been taking Tylenol since then, as soon as it wears off bottom teeth start to hurt again. Went to the dentist today and he filed the tooth down, but the bottom teeth still hurt. Could the crowned tooth be higher than the other teeth causing the two that are further forward to put more pressure on the ones below? What else could be causing this pain? The temporary crown only hurts when I chew on it, otherwise the tooth that was worked on is not that sore...Thanks, Carrie
DEMO	Strange vaginal discharge. Help me, I want my life back.	\A long time ago, I started getting a white, or yellowish discharge that smelled like vinegar and tasted bitter. They gave me antibiotics for BV, without even testing me. Then I got a very severe urinary tract infection. I was given strong antibiotics, again. All went back to normal and all was well. Then I got what they thought was a yeast infection, they tested me for STDs and did a pap. Everything came back normal and I didn't even have a yeast infection to begin with. I got several yeast infections (about 4 or 5) in the past 4 months. Now I don't know what's going on. My vagina feels raw, doesn't itch or burn, but still I get this thick, creamy, whitish, yellow discharge, that smells like vinegar and tastes bitter. I can no longer stay wet during sex, and sometimes cant even get wet. I can no longer orgasm, it hurts to have sex. Whatever this is, it is taking over my life. I'm embarrassed, and ashamed to let him even touch me. I desperately need someone to tell me what is going on with my body so that I can get my life back.I am on birth control, but i NEVER had these symptoms before, and i never had a reaction to condoms.

DEMO	A young women experiencing clit discomfert/pain!	** Virgin, and no sexual activity. and no infections. I saw a gyno and was told that I was being irritated to the soap, fabric softer or the tightness of my clothes. I wear loose fitting cotton underwear. I had mentioned to them that i was experiencing mainly pinchy like sensations and achy where inner labias meet clit. I had cleaned there almost everyday in a warm bath, which I was told not to clean so deaply because vagina is self cleaning and it has a certain PH. But with the small amount of build up that I am to allow, I feel as if I had a small piece of toilet paper between the clit and left inner labia. It was a sensation like minor pin like pokes, I'd hardly call it pinching. But more like a dragging of a fine needle too, just like something was there. So I had gently cleaned only that side off build up, and no longer had that feeling when I was sitting. But sometimes during the time of ovulating and or just before my period, when I walk I can get a scraping like skratch, like a dragging of the two tissues against eachother, and it is quiet painful. It only happens during a couple steps that I take, and it fades away when I slow down my walking. This is the most form of pain I can get. Is this because I cleaned the build up away a day ago? Or is it because I am expecting my period any day now? Oh, I can sometimes be slitghly itchy but I dont feel the need to skratch or rub it away. My secretions are normal, im told. PLease answer, thanks!! Any suggestions as to what this can be and/or what I can do to make it better please? Can it be clitorodynia? or?This discussion is related toSwollen Lump on Outer Vagina/Groin.
TRMT	interesting article on mainstream medicine	"Ten realizations about ""mainstream medicine""When it comes to whether mainstream medicine really works, here are ten important ""reality check"" realizations to keep in mind:#1) If mainstream medicine really worked, then drug companies wouldn't have to commit scientific fraud to fake their clinical trials, would they?#2) If mainstream medicine really worked, then doctors, drugs companies and the FDA wouldn't be afraid of competition from nutritional supplements and natural remedies, and they wouldn't keep trying to censor or outlaw those natural remedies.#3) If mainstream medicine really worked, drug companies would gladly test their drugs side-by-side with nutritional remedies to see what works best. (http://www.naturalnews.com/028473_Z...)#4) If mainstream medicine really worked, health insurance costs would be extremely low. The only reason health insurance costs so much is because mainstream medicine doesn't cure anybody, and patients stay sick, which costs more money to keep treating!#5) If mainstream medicine really worked, then all the other countries in the world would be looking at the U.S. health care system and saying, ""Wow, we want THAT!""#6) If mainstream medicine really worked, drug companies would be out of business because virtually everybody would be healthy and therefore not need drugs on an ongoing basis.#7) If mainstream medicine really worked, doctors would largely put themselves out of business by teaching patients how to take care of their own health.#8) If mainstream medicine really worked, drug companies like Johnson & Johnson wouldn't have to pay kickbacks (bribes) to nursing homes to entice them to push more of their drugs onto helpless senior citizens.#9) If mainstream medicine really worked, the treatment of teenagers with chemotherapy wouldn't have to be enforced by court order with the threat of arrest and imprisonment of the parents (as happens in the U.S. today). (http://www.naturalnews.com/Abraham_...)#10) If mainstream medicine really worked, drug companies wouldn't need to advertise on television to persuade people to take drugs they don't need.Now, to hear mainstream medicine pushers say it, the only reason Americans are so sick and diseased right now is because -- get this -- not enough people are taking enough medications!Yes... if they could only convince more parents to drug more babies and toddlers; or if they could get more teens on four, five or six drugs at once; or if they could convince nursing homes to pop a dozen different meds into the mouths of senior citizens then we'd all be healthier!America, you see, suffers from a medication deficiency. That's the line of mainstream medicine: More meds = less disease. And now, they're trying to convince everyone that even healthy people now need meds (statin drugs) even if they show no symptoms of disease.So now -- get this -- being healthy is no longer enough to avoid medications! We're ALL supposed to be medicated, whether we're healthy or not.Mainstream medicine, you see, isn't satisfied to just treat sick people with its medications, radiation machines and surgical procedures: It wants to put all the healthy people on pills, too.And what will be the result of all this? Imagine in your own mind, for a moment: What will be the result if, say, Americans start taking twice as much medication as they do right now. Will Americans be healthier?Of course not. They will be more diseased. More medicated and chemically contaminated. The fish downstream will be even more polluted with pharmaceutical runoff and the bio sludge human waste ""compost"" products now being put on farms will be even more heavily saturated with medication chemicals.Will that create health for America? Of course not. Mainstream medicine does not work. And pushing mainstream medicine onto more people will only cause more sickness, more suffering and more bankruptcies across American households.It will, however, accomplish one very important thing: The obscene financial enrichment of a few powerful corporations like Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca.And that, my friends, is the entire point of mainstream medicine: To mainline the profits for Big Pharma, sideline the legitimate health problems of the American people, and streamline the criminal soaking of the rich, the poor and the recently-insured in order to turn sickness into profit.That's mainstream medicine for you. I'm sure glad I don't use it.http://www.naturalnews.com/028561_mainstream_medicine_health_care.html"

SOCL	SOAR BEYOND YOUR FEARS !!!	"SOAR BEYOND YOUR FEARS !!!Once there was a king who received a gift of two magnificent falcons from Arabia. They were peregrine falcons, the most beautiful birds he had ever seen. He gave the precious birds to his head falconer to be trained.Months passed and one day the head falconer informed the king that though one of the falcons was flying majestically, soaring high in the sky, the other bird had not moved from its branch since the day it had arrived.The king summoned healers and sorcerers from all the land to tend to the falcon, but no one could make the bird fly. He presented the task to the member of his court, but the next day, the king saw through the palace window that the bird had still not moved from its perch. Having tried everything else, the king thought to himself, ""May be I need someone more familiar with the countryside to understand the nature of this problem."" So he cried out to his court, ""Go and get a farmer.""In the morning, the king was thrilled to see the falcon soaring high above the palace gardens. He said to his court, ""Bring me the doer of this miracle.""The court quickly located the farmer, who came and stood before the king. The king asked him, ""How did you make the falcon fly?""With his head bowed, the farmer said to the king, "" It was very easy, your highness. I simply cut the branch where the bird was sitting.""We are all made to fly -- to realize our incredible potential as human beings. But instead of doing that, we sit on our branches, clinging to the things that are familiar to us. The possibilities are endless, but for most of us, they remain undiscovered. We conform to the familiar, the comfortable, the mundane. So for the most part, our lives are mediocre instead of exciting, thrilling and fulfilling.So let us learn to destroy the branch of fear we cling to and free ourselves to the glory of flight."
FAML	9 yr old giving our valuables away..help!	My nine yr old daughter has been 'trading' many of her toys in which she always gives expensive items away in exchange for 'bubble gum machine' items. When I find this out, I make her return the items and get her things back, but I think most of the time I am unaware of it, until I realize something is missing. I suspect she traded her nintendo DS, since it vanished a while back. She recently confessed when I was looking for my $400.00 heart diamond necklace, that she traded it to the 9 yr old neighbor boy for $1.00. Of course, the boy can't seem to find it, so I will not get this back. The boy's mother believes the boy, when he told her that my daughter kept pesting him for the trade. My daughter tells me that he was the one coaxing her to get the necklace. I believe her. She has been trading expensive items with this same boy quite often, in which I made her go to his house and get her items back. The mother said she was not aware of all of the trading going on. First I want to say, I thought I was a good mother. My kids never went without anything, for the most part, they have more than most of their friends have. My questions are: Why does my daughter not understand or seem to care about the value of things. Why does she continue to do this? I ground her and take her things away for punishment, but she does it again. In my opinion, I think my neighbors 9 yr old boy was wrong also, and I think they should offer to help pay for the loss. Am I wrong here? The response I got from the mother is that her children would never lie, cheat or steal, and they seem to doubt the value of my necklace, since i have no receipt. This necklace had alot of diamonds and a very good chain. I feel betrayed by my own daughter, she said she is sorry, but I really don't think she understands the value and the wrong doing. I am very stressed over this and need some good advice. Thanks!

GOAL	sudden swelling eye	The left side of my head started hurting suddenly and the pain just kept on escalating.. then it sort of focused directly on my left eye - the eye lids (mainly the bottom) started swelling up really fast. Vision is slightly blurred.. This has never happened to me before... I am pretty sure it is not a stye... I have had them before and the pain is different. Does anyone know what this could be? Thank you!Oh, also, earlier today I was taking a picture of my left eye (coincidence?) I forgot to turn the flash off and the flash went directly into my eye - but I felt no immediate pain. Swelling occurred few hours later. Could this be the reason? I am not sure..

SOCL	U.S. shamefully slow to help vets	"Editor's note: Paul Rieckhoff is an Iraq veteran, the founder and executive director of Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) and the author of ""Chasing Ghosts."" Follow him on Twitter @PaulRieckhoff.(CNN) -- Imagine you served for one year with the U.S. Army in Iraq. Imagine you served an additional tour in Afghanistan a year later.And imagine being injured in that last tour after a roadside bomb exploded from beneath a trashcan as your Humvee rolled by. Your buddy sitting next to you was killed. After you left the Army and returned home, you had trouble focusing. You had headaches and issues with your vision. You realize you returned with what might be a Traumatic Brain Injury. And maybe Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, too.Imagine you also have two kids younger than 7 who haven't seen you very much for the last half decade. Imagine you're struggling to find a job. You've got a lot on your plate. And you're understandably stressed.You don't want to let down your family. And you don't want to be viewed as weak or a wimp by your buddies.You summon the courage to overcome the stigma, and you go to your local Department of Veterans Affairs to get some help. You file a claim for disability benefits to get the care and compensation you've earned and the support you need to keep your family afloat financially. You're hopeful.Now imagine waiting 600 days before you get an answer from the Department of Veterans Affairs. 600 days.600 days of staring at your mailbox. 600 days of phone calls to check in. 600 days of bills piling up. 600 days of disappointment.Sounds crazy, right? Well, for thousands of veterans nationwide, it's real life.If you are a young vet who's filed a claim with the Department of Veterans Affairs in New York or Los Angeles, you will wait an average of 600 days. And you're not alone.More than 900,000 veterans of all generations are stuck in a bureaucratic logjam that, in 2013, is the almost too absurd to believe. After 10 years of war, three VA secretaries, and an increase in the overall department budget of 40% since 2009, an incredible 97% of veteran's claims are still on paper.Yep, paper.America has soldiers in Nevada piloting drones remotely that can strike a target thousands of miles and two continents away, but 97% of our veterans' benefits claims are still on paper.Earlier this month, the Center for Investigative Reporting released a leaked internal VA document that showed the entire world what veterans nationwide have known for years: the VA backlog problem is even worse than reported.The VA has reported that the average claim wait time was 273 days. For the first claim filed, it's longer: 316 to 327 days. In Los Angeles, that figure is 619. In New York, it's 642. In Indianapolis, it's 612 days. And vets with first-time claims in Reno, Nevada, wait 681 days.The VA has testified that it has hired 3,300 new claims processors, but it has failed to report that, because of staff turnover, the net increase in processors is only 300 since 2010. And, in Chicago; Waco, Texas; and Oakland, California, the overall number of claims processors has gone down.Since the internal documents were leaked last week, we've yet to see a public response from VA Secretary Eric Shinseki or from the commander in chief.Some 2.6 million men and woman answered the call to serve in Iraq and Afghanistan. But now, a decade later, President Barack Obama is not answering their calls for help. And the public still doesn't seem to get it.That's why this week I'm joining veterans from across America as we take our stories to Washington.Veteran leaders from some 22 states are converging on the Capitol to ""Storm the Hill,"" where we'll be pressing elected officials to confront and solve the backlog. You can see their faces and read about their stories at the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America website, www.IAVA.org. They are an amazing group of men and women (and one dog) that have overcome tremendous obstacles. And now, they're taking on another one: the VA backlog.Just like we've been trained, we won't quit until the job is done. No matter how long it takes, we'll keep fighting.Our brothers and sisters deserve support for their sacrifices. And every single American should stand with us to #EndTheVAbacklog once and for all.Ten years after the start of the Iraq War, there are a lot of folks who say they support the troops. Now is the time for them to show it.http://www.cnn.com/2013/03/19/opinion/rieckhoff-veteran-benefit-logjam/index.html?hpt=hp_c2"
DISE	Day 8.. damn it lol	As I stated above day 8... damn it lol Well in Dec. I got hit with PAWS.. OMG I was fine, all was going great. no cravings no nothing. going to the gym 4-5 times a week!!! eating right no alcohol.. nadda...I finished my massage classes.. was 2 months into seeing clients.. THEN BAM woke up one morning with a slight pain in my head.. hmmm i thought. eh it will go away. I started walking around and it was like a white noise pain( this is difficult to discribe, as it is an odd sensation, its like someone hit a tuning fork in your mind, and every step you take hits it more and more then you sweat.. Then I was thinking this is like im going through withdrawals AGAIN!. I kept thinkin I havent taking any pills nothing!! WTH am I getting withdrawal symptoms? Then I can deal with the body stuff fine I was still going to gym and getting cold chills in the sauna and steam room. wasn't so bad.. BUT when I started getting pain at night and it interfering with my sleep, I couldn't take it.. it was bad.. joint pain like I couldn't believe runny nose eyes. Diarrhea it wasnt the flu i felt fine during the day other then some slight goose bumps chill sensations.. didnt feel exhausted.. no fever. after about 5 days of this and no or little sleep I found my dealer again and started up I figured only a few days then ill be fine.. YA well.. even now you can lie to yourself.. 3 months later truth awakens in us all. SO now im starting out on day 5 now. this time it isnt too too bad... I mean I feel like crap and goose bump chills no fever, the HOT baths in epson salt helps SO MUCH!!.

FAML	Is it behavioral	"My 9 year old son has all of a sudden developed a problem urinating. Of course we start by going to a doctor thinking possible UTI. That test came back negative. So after alot of questions about school, friends, and inappropriate touching the doctor came to the conclusion that this was a behavorial issue. They feel that his bladder has been over-stretched for such a long period of time that it does not return to a normal size after urinating. As a mother I have watched for two days now as my sits on the toilet for hours at a time because he is overly concerned that he will have an accident. He cries not because of pain but he says that he always feels that he must urinate. As soon as he ""empties"" his bladder and stands up he feels that he must go again. Can this really be a behavorial issue?"

PREG	No ultrasound 3rd trimest normal?	Hello ladies! I'm 37 weeks pregnant and have dialated 1cm, cramping a lot. I have read on here that many have had ultrasounds later in pregnancy, but I honestly haven't had one since early in my last trimester. Is that normal, or should I say something to the doctor? I have a different doctor with this pregnancy than I had with my last, the last one did many throughout. I am getting nervous now that we're nearing the end. I just want her to be healthy!

TRMT	Chromium GTF Supplementation during pregnancy for insulin resistance.	"I'm 24 years old, and pregnant for the first time. With insulin resistance. I'm almost 27 weeks and have managed glucose control perfectly with diet and exercise. To attain even better control though, around 20 weeks my naturopath put me on 300mcg of chromium a day. I'm also taking 2000mg of metformin.Obviously glucose control gets harder during the third trimester. I've gradually increased my chromium intake over the last 7 weeks. I'm currently taking 2500mcg - 3000mcg a day now. Without it, my control isn't that the best (still not enough for insulin usage, but I'm trying to avoid insulin therapy at all costs anyways).I've googled, but cannot find any relevant information. Can taking <3000mcg of chromium GTF a day be harmful to my child? I'd imagine uncontrolled blood sugar would outweigh the risks of ""overdoing it"" on the chromium, right?. And I'd assume a vitamin is better than adding more medication into my diet?"
DISE	Bi-polar Highs	Bi-Polarity is such an interesting disease to me. Being a medical student with BP, I'm constantly calculating my own moodiness. The most irrational thing about BP is the addictiveness of the high. The amount of work, calculating, inventing, and exercise I do while in a euphoric state makes it really hard to take medicine (I do but you see my point). It is a drug that our brains are chemically injecting into us. Everything is beautiful, wonderful. The possibilities are limitless.I understand the danger, but does anyone else agree with me on this? It takes someone with BP to truly understand what euphoria is like. I don't think many people have or ever will experience that kind of high (without drugs lol). Do you find it hard to take medicine when you are high? Where do you place your focus and energy? What is the strangest thing you've done on a euphoric stint?

SOCL	Can low cholesterol be bad for you?	"This question is actually about my husband, as I worry about his health.    He is 41 years old, weighs about 215 pounds and is 5'10"" tall.    He finally went to the doctor for the first time in about 10 years for an ear ache.    The doctor did standard bloodwork and checked his cholesterol.    The first time the results came back, the doctor thought they made a mistake and had my husband re-tested.    Again, his results came back as an overall cholesterol of 91.    I've read articles that cholesterol that is too low is also bad for you and tried to explain to my husband that he should follow up with the physician and ask more questions.    I have to add that he drinks alcohol daily (6-9 beers) and smokes pot several times per week.    I'm worried that he is going to ignore something that may be important, just because his bloodwork says that his cholesterol is ""great"".    Any advice is welcome.Thanks."

Just seems that life takes over once in a while............Anyway, I'm sitting at 147, which is up 3 pounds.    My eating has not changed, but I have not been exercising the way I should be because of the way I've been feeling.    With my sluggish thyroid, I can tell that exercise is crucial to even being able to maintain my weight, let alone lose.I hope to get in a good work out, or at least a relatively long walk today, but first I've got to get house work done and get ready for the coming work week.Will be interested in seeing how everyone else it doing.
TRMT	Mirena IUD Experience	"Wow! Where do I begin? I'm 20+ and I've had my IUD in for nearly 2.5 months. Before the IUD was inserted I heard nothing but great things about the Mirena from all of my doctors. Then, 8 weeks after I had my baby and the IUD was inserted, I have heard nothing but gruesome horror stories about this device from others. BUT let me express to you my experience thus far.Irregular Periods & CrampingSince insertion of the IUD, I have only experienced light spotting. However, I have been experiencing some severe cramping off and on (approx. 1-2 times a day). Literally, it feels as though someone is shoving a knife in my stomach. Last week, I went in for a checkup to see if the device had been improperly placed. The ultrasound tech performed a trans-vaginal & regular ultrasound on me. According to my Dr., the IUD was properly placed & the results looked phenomenal. BUT why didn't I feel PHENOMENAL? As explained by my Dr., severe cramping is a normal symptom and will probably occur for the next couple of months. I have yet to discover if this cramping will really and truly go away.Weight:After birth, I weighed 232. Before I had the Mirena inserted 8 weeks later, I weighed 207. Since I've had the Mirena, I've lost 4 lbs and am still losing. Also, I do not diet or exercise. However, I do believe the fact that I breastfeed may play a major role in my weight loss.Sex Drive:Ha! Not to be too detailed BUT I don't think I can get enough of my husband. LOL!!!! Before I got the IUD, our sex life was great. Afterwards, it was even greater. I will leave it at that!Depression:I'm pretty sure someone would become depressed after finding out that they have something inserted in them that could possibly cause them more harm than good. I've found myself wrecking my brain over whether I should keep this thing in or take it out. I've start thinking crazy thoughts like, ""what if I die and my baby is left motherless"" or ""what if I can never conceive again""? Does that not sound depressing? Well, other than what I've mentioned I do not think I am so depressed that I need antidepressants. I'm just trying to understand if this thing is for me or against me. That's all.Hair Loss:Well, my hair always falls out when I comb it. BUT not so much to where it is noticeable. Since this has been going on since before I got the Mirena, I do not think it has anything to do with it,Overall:My experience with the Mirena has not been so bad as others. The only downfall for me is the severe cramping. I will update in a few months if things begin to go downhill for me."

DISE	Severe gas/Diarrhea/Constipation	Over the past few months I've had constipation frequently. Fortunately, bowel movement always resumed within 1-2 weeks. Recently, I got constipated once again. Through the past three weeks I've been constipated. Sometimes I would get some bowel movement, but then I would be constipated once more within a day. This went on until the middle of last week. That was when I began to get diarrhea. I got the urge to use the restroom often during the school day but was often forced to simply ignore because we are busy in all my classes getting school work turned in and studying for exams, so I went to the bathroom when I got home. On Saturday (yesterday) my diarrhea began to turn from typical to very watery. It also burned quite a bit as I used the restroom. Coloration, however remained dark. I would say that I used the restroom about once every thirty minutes to an hour and was not comfortable getting too far away from the toilet seat. Also it should be noted that after every bathroom run I still felt as if I needed to use the restroom but couldn't, almost as if there was some type of blockage or still some constipation. Today I continued to follow this pattern however the coloration of my stool liquid lightened significantly, from a dark color almost to a tan. Also I noticed that it wasn't nearly as acidic. In addition to this I suffered from severe gas all day. Even now my abdomen continues to rumble. At one point during the day I could not release the pressure building up in my abdomen and I had sharp gas pains in my abdomen. I struggled to pass gas and could even feel the gas bubble sliding down and then moving back up as I applied and released preassure. Also just a side note, I did not use the restroom nearly as often today, maybe only five or six times. I am bewildered by this entire occurrence and    really don't know what to think. Please enlighten me.

DISE	My cousin passed away	I haven't posted in a very long time. Don't seem to be getting any better. Pain meds keep pain almost manageable, as long as I don't get too active.But that's not why I am posting today.My cousin Ervin passed away 3 weeks ago. He lived with MS for 18 years. He was diagnosed at the age of 48, and it advanced quickly, long before any of the new treatments could help him. He was in a wheelchair within 4 years of his dx.I don't know why I am telling all of you, except maybe to encourage you never to give up.I believe he survived so long because his wife and children and grandchildren gave him the will to live.A few of us in the family got together on Easter and that day, there were no tears. We shared happy memories of his life.Still, he is sadly missed.Hugs,Sheila

FAML	my grandson is 7 years old and very angry	My grandson was born very early weighing only 2lbs. 9oz.    He had complications but came through them but stayed in the hospital for 2 months.    He is a very bright and creative child.    He is also very quiet and shy and spends a lot of time alone.    He does very well in school and is even in some talented and gifted classes.    My concern is that he throws fits at school and now is throwing fits on a regular basis.    If he cannot do something perfect he gets very angry.    I had him twice in the last month and was shocked at the fits that he was throwing.    I did even pop him once because he threw a toy down and caught me off guard and I just reacted.    Normally I do not spank my grandkids.    Also, he is so disrespectful to me and really won't even talk to me.    I sometimes have to ask him a question several times before he will answer me and his answers are very monotone and rude.    He gets so angry playing video games that he will begin to cry his frustration level gets so high.    I am pretty sure that his dad acts this way to him and this is where he is learning this behavior.    I am worried about my grandson.    I try to talk to my son about his behavior but he says he knows he needs to change but he doesn't think he can.    I have to be very careful because I know if I say too much I will probably get told to mind my own business.    I am so worried about my grandson, he is way too young too be so angry, I have never seen a 7 year old behave this way.    I know you can't tell me what to do but possibly some suggestions.    I would appreciate it.

FAML	Constipation and Behavior	I am a school psychologist and am currently assessing a    3 1/2 year old student who suffers from significant constipation. The doctors he is seeing are relating the disorder to control. The assessment is revealing that although he has intact speech and language skills he does not use his speech often....he is very quiet. Autism has been ruled out. He is also extremely moody and often tantrums. My gut tells me that much of his behavior can be connected to the constipation due to the fact that he most likely doesn't feel good. My question is if anyone knows of the behavioral implications for children who suffer from significant constipation.

FAML	4 year old son doesn't listen to me	I have a 41/2 yr old son and he has never gotten in trouble at his preschool or daycare EVER..he is actually one of the best behaved kids in his class; however with me that is not the case. If he doesn't get what he wants he throws a fit, if he makes a mess he refuses to help clean up, he wants to eat junk food and not dinner and when I tell him no he throws a fit, he wants toys or something EVERY store we go to. He is a sweet boy and is not hyper active; he just seems to be spoiled and want to do whatever he wants and I can't handle it anymore. I am not sure if this is normal behavior for his age. I try time out, taking away toys, etc. but it just doesn't seem to change. I also can not get him to go to bed at a decent hour...like tonight I had him in bed by 9:15..read him a book and left the room and it is now 11 pm and he is still awake. SOME ONE HELP!!!!This discussion is related to4 year old does not listen.

DISE	Withdrawal from Oxycondn	I developed a case of shingles the last of January and was presicribed Hydrocoden 750mg 1-2 tabs every 4-6 hours for the pain.On May 15 I went to a different physician who prescribed Oxycoden 20mg 1X12 hrs. Initially the Oxy made me feel much better & I had more energy.I soon felt a need to take more to get the same effect, so I started taking (2) in the morning and (1) in the evening. On a subsequent visit he assured me that with a body weight of 290# there was no problem taking (2) 20mg in the morning and (1) in the evening.I have been taking pain killers for over 6 months and am convinced that I am addicted. I do not need them for pain but I take them to maintain a certain feeling.I quit taking the Oxy 48 hrs ago and have experienced chills, hot flashs, nausea, a runny nose, sneezing, and I feel terrible.I still do not have any physical pain except that associated with withdrawal.My question is will 200 mg Ibuprofen help my withdrawal (especially sleeping) or should I just continue suffering until my body has cleansed itself of the Oxy addiction?
DISE	really worried	i recently put a post on here with no replies...since my last post i have recently had a colposcopy and my doctor called me a week later and rather than giving me a follow up colposcopy up in six monthes from now she pushed it to november. for a minute i thought maybe this isnt serious but now im having doubts again... if anyone has any experience or knowledge on the whole cervical cancer diagnosis process i would really like to hear from them...you can read my last post to know more about my situation. i only just turned 20 in september and i have been with the same guy for 2 years now. so what does all of this mean?has anyone else ever had a colposcopy and is so why?how long dows it take to get clear results other than just 'abnormal'?
PREG	anyone ever have cysts on clomid and still get pregnant?	So this is my 3rd time on clomid, and they just doubled the dose to 100mg.    I was at what I think could be 2 dpo, and just after my dh and I bd, I ruptured a cyst.    I knew it right away, because this has happened 4 times before in my life.    Turns out I have 2 cysts, and of course, I can't see my doc til tomorrow (this happened Sunday night), but my question is - is this month on clomid shot?    Even with the cysts, could I have ovulated properly and possibly still get pregnant?    I don't have very high expectations :o(
GOAL	tooth pain	I have severe pain in my tooth opposing a crown that was put in last month. I went to the dentist and the xray showed there was no cavity.    He said we would monitor the tooth and I should come back in a month, but I am in severe pain.I have never had a filling in this tooth.    There is no pain in my gum, but the pain in the tooth is so strong and lasts for at least a minute at a time.    It is recurring and does not only come when I drink something hot or cold.    In fact, I have started to drink cold water during pain attacks because I prefer that pain to the pain I feel.HELP!    What is wrong with me?

DEMO	Whats wrong??	hello, i am 23 and have been on the pill for about 3 years now because my period was so out of whack, about a year ago they switched my pills, and i never had any problems with them. i started my period on March 18 then on April 2nd i started to spot, it was very light pink then after two days of that it got a little darker and heavier. it lasted about 10 days, i should have started my period on April 15th and I haven't, would this spotting have taken the place of my period? I'm a little curious about this because i would hate for my period to be so irregular that it messes me up on having kids in the future. And incase this matters, my fiance and i have sex regularly and do not use protection and he rarely ever pulls out.Any Suggestions??

PREG	Help....Low AFP results!!!!!	I have a question about low AFP results in the triple screen test.    My friend just turned 37 and is 4 months preggo.    She got her results back today that said she had a low AFP number.    Her last ultrasound checked for the thickness in the babys neck and everything looked okay.    She cannot get in to see her doctor until two weeks from now and is contemplating an amniocentesis.    Does anyone know the odds of her baby having down symdrome? Does anyone know of someone that had a good outcome even though they had low AFP numbers???

SOCL	Triple test confusion	I did the quad test at 16.1w according to LMP, and my result came back with a 1:227 risk for Down's. The MoM values for AFP was 0.53 (17.8 ng/mL), uE3 was 0.79 ( 2.16 ng/mL), hCG was 0.82 ( 21.4 IU/mL), inhibinA was 2.26 ( 427.0 pg/mL). My age at term would be about 31 years.I repeated the triple screen at 17.4 weeks according to LMP (though U/S that day gave a GA of 18w2d), and this time my risk was calculated to be 1:8000. The MoM values for    AFP was 0.48 (27.5 ng/mL), uE3 was 4.13 (5.6 ng/mL), and hCG was 0.94 (23.2 IU/mL). Note that this was done in a different lab.I would like to add that I had also done a first trimester NT plus PAPPA blood screen, which gave me a down's risk of < 1:5000. The MoM for NT was 0.8, and the PAPPA was 1.73.Additionally my level II U/S had no markers and everything looked absolutely normal. My question is based on the way my uE3 changed between the 2 maternal serum tests, I think the risk changed significantly. Does this change in uE3 seem like what would be expected at that stage in pregnancy? How much should I worry about this first multiple marker result though it seems like a false positive?I declined the amnio but now am going back and forth wondering if that was the right decision. I am looking for someone to look at my numbers closely, and see if they seem possible for an unaffected pregnancy. Just to add, I am carrying a female fetus if that adds any more information and my racial origin is Asian.I really look forward to an answer from one of the doctors since I think I am running out of time for an amnio.Thanks!
FAML	someone PLEASE help me	"I have a 4 year old son. He has been to a psychologist, pshychiatrist and therepist. 2 different offices. Psychologist was first. This one diagnosed my son with have ADD, ADHD, ODD, and OCD. He then referred us to a psychiatrist because of the severity of his case because his thought was he would need to be put on medication.We then saw the therepist for the initial evaluation. I expressed my concerns. Agressiveness, easily aggrivated, COMPLETE disreguard for his belongings, not sleeping at night (by this I mean he went to bed at 8:30 and wouldn't fall asleep until midnight or after, and got up 3 times during the night, and woke up at 5:30).As for the disreguard for his toys, by this, I mean the punishment would be having toys taken away. After the second time in doing this, he would go and get a trash bag and hand it to me and tell me ""ok, throw it away. I don't care mommy"" - at tjis point he was THREE. He pulled all the clothes out of his dresser drawers, out of the closet, then, would take the bowl in his potty seat that we had put in his room for middle of the night potty issues, would pee or poop in it, then fling it around the room. And ripped the pages out of every book he had. And before someone says it, I DID TAKE THE TOYS AND BOOKS AND EVEN THE CLOTHING OUT OF HIS ROOM. This resulted in him using his fingernails and peeling off the paint on the walls. Then at one point tore open his pillow and ripped apart his blankets.Therepist decided we needed to see the doctor. She too said all of the things the psychologist did, with the addition of insomnia (which I too suffer SEVERELY from).Saw the doctor. Doctor gave us 4 medications to research in case we changed our minds on medicating our 3 year old. Which, we did eventually change our minds on. He was put on ritalin. Worked our way up to 25mg in the morning and 10mg in the evening. He was also put on, after we worked our way up, 1.5mg risperidone every evening at dinner time to help his behavioral issues at night and to help him sleep. Which, I must admit, the risperidone did help him sleep. However, the ritalin, even though it did help with the out of control hyperactivity, also somehow caused him to space out in his preschool class. (Put him in preK so he would have other children his age to play with and socialize with in hopes it would help).So. Here it is. He has had ALL of his toys taken away, aside from books which I have him sit and read even if it is just making words up. He is now getting up 5-7 times a night, and has now resorted to sneaking food (by the way he has been off all medication for over 2 months now, so no its not the risperidone causing him to be hungry). He has become even more verbally aggressive with the addition of phsyically aggrissive which is now causing issues in school (he pushed a little boy in his class, then took a toy from another and hit him with it) and is becoming very physical with myself, my husband and my daughter (his almost 2 year old sister) as well. He knows he is to behave if he wants his toys back, but continues to disobey and spits when he is asked to do something. He now also CRIES, AAALLLLLL the time. For nothing, and everything. He hits and kicks our 3 dogs and 3 cats (yes he has even been nipped at once or twice, which you would think would have had SOME impact, but continues to do this anyway --scares me more now that he has begun to do this with our 70lb, 11 month old german sheppherd--). He knows about Santa and has been told he will be put on the naughty list. His response has been ""so? I don't care. You don't tell him what him what to do. He'll bring them anyway"".So. No toys, he gets sent to his room, is made to do chores, sits in a time out chair, goes to bed early, has any other ""priviledge"" taken away if it is needed... and probably just about anything else you could think of. I cannot do this anymore. I am utterly exhausted, and have been pushed beyond my breaking point, broken and am almost to my shattering point. I have researched every other possible alternative and tried them all for endless weeks all of them failing. I am embarrassed to take him into public for the way he acts, and feel like a failure as a mother that I cannot find a way to control my FOUR year old son.I am in desperate need of help. Please. Anybody."

GOAL	Geographic Tongue	"About 2 minths ago I noticed what looked like a small red patch with a little outline of white around it. ringworm looking, at the tip of my tongue. It is still there. It moves around a little, but is always at the tip. Sometimes it is a little more prominent than others, and I have obsessed myself with discovering what it could be. I have found the term ""Geographic Tongue"" and it seems to describe this. Could this be what it is? It is mildly sore...like I burnt the end of my tongue with hot coffee. I even have a few small lines that have appeared on my tongue. Like little slits. I am just curious if this meets the sescription of geographic tongue. I never noticed it there in my life til about 2-3 months ago. I have tried different types of gargle, and eating less spicy foods. I guess it helps to some degree, but is still there nonetheless. Does this ever go away? Is there any treatment or remedy? And does it sound like geographic tongue?This discussion is related toDoes this sound like geographic tongue?."
TRMT	Seeking advice and answers	"My wife went for her annual checkup in February 09 and her OBGYN diagnosed her with possible Cancer recommending total hysterectomy and removal of everthing. Immediately my wife began to shut me out both emotionally and physically. Before this time, we had a very loving and intimate life. My wife was 31 at this time and did not plan to have more children, although she loves children. We have 2 wonderful children. Her OBGYN did not recommend a second opinion and my wife put her total trust in him. In June 09 my wife had the surgery and nearly lost her life due to lose of blood from something going wrong during surgery that was to this day never explained to us on what exactly went wrong. My wife spent 4 days in ICU on a ventilator and I feared I would lose her. She is the love of my life and I cherish her. Life for us has not been the same, in a way I feel like the DR took my wife's soul away from her with regard to me. She treats everyone the same as before but me she treats differently. She is withdrawn from me. We have not been intimate in 15 months ever since the first diagnosis. I have tried to rationally talk to her but she seems to go on the defense and accuse me of telling her of her inadequacies when all I am trying to do is ask questions on how she feels and try to get her to open up emotionally and physically toward me. It breaks my heart. I love this woman and would die for her or my children. I almost feel as if I said bye to her the day she had the surgery. She has told me that she constantly feels like she is ""jumping out of her skin,"" cannot stand to be held or touched, has absolutely no libido or desire to even try intimate relations. I have noticed that she stares out in space a lot, she does not get a full nights sleep, has constant anxiety, constant severe headaches, constant tenderness of breasts, nausea, vomiting, and weight lose. I desire this woman so much that it is difficult to not be with your wife and the woman I love to be with the most. I want to help her so bad but do not know what to do. I do know that she has experienced grief toward feeling she has lost something cause she cannot stand to see babies and she loves babies and children. It has been 1 year since the surgery and some of these symptoms I have witnessed seem to be worsening. I have all but given up talking with her concerning intimacy and am afraid to do more than hug her or give her a peck for fear of pushing her away even though my desire is so much more. she has states that she cannot even hold or hug our children for long periods due to feeling smothered. She has since left her former OBGYN due to the way he treated her after the surgery. She went for a check-up after the surgery and came home in a great deal of pain and crying and stated she felt as if he was trying to sweep her under the rug. She has since went to a new OBGYN and the only thing she is prescribed is birth control and antidepressant Wellebutrin. Is there someone out there that can give me advice and answers as to how to help my wife or communicate with her without her defensiveness. I feel lost and long to be close to her. She is only 32 now and it has been 1 year since the surgery. Now my wife is a very private person who does not open up very well and is very modest. I have never went to the DR with her nor do I know who her new DR is. I would love to help her to take care of the issues. Any help please. I love this woman. How long can this ""surgical-menapause"" last or is she going through surgical-menapause?"

DISE	asthma	I have a question. While stationed in Korea, I got a real bad cold, and had severe allergies at that time, and a few days after getting the cold, I developed shortness of breath really bad.    I went to the doc, and they said I developed asthma from the combo of the cold and allergies.    So I saw specialists etc, while trying to get better, but nothing really helped although the asthma meds help a little.    My actual question is this: If I don't have coughing or wheezing, but have shortness of breath and hot flashes alot, is this asthma or something else?    Could it be some weird Korean disease instead of asthma?    When I use albuterol it does open up my airways, but why do I get the hot flashes and not have a cough or wheeze? Anyone have any idea? My doc won't listen to me, he says I just have asthma, plain and simple.    I am open to ideas, suggestions.    Thanks!    B.

SOCL	US to provide nearly $2bn for two solar energy projects	"Nearly $2bn (Ã‚ £1.3bn) in loan guarantees will be given to two companies to kick-start the US solar energy industry, President Barack Obama has announced.One of the firms, Abenoga Solar, says that it is planning to build the largest solar power plant in the world in Arizona.Mr Obama said the projects would provide more than 5,000 new jobs.The Arizona plant should power 70,000 homes and cut carbon dioxide emissions.The money will come from government stimulus funds designed to boost the economy during the recession.Outlining the ""Solana"" project at Gila Bend near Phoenix, Abenoga said it would have an area of 1,900 acres, using thermal storage-equipped parabolic trough technology, with 280 MW of power output capacity.According to the company's website, 1,500 new jobs will be created during the plant's construction with 100 positions for staff to maintain it.'Aggressive'The second company, Abound Solar Manufacturing, will manufacture state-of-the-art thin film solar panels, the first time anywhere that such technology has been used commercially, the BBC's Jane O'Brien reports from Washington.Plants will be built in Colorado and Indiana, creating 2,000 construction jobs and 1,500 permanent jobs, the Associated Press reports.President Obama had promised during his election campaign for the White House to create manufacturing and construction jobs in the green power industry.""We're going to to keep competing aggressively to make sure the jobs and industries of the future are taking root right here in America,"" he said on Saturday.The renewable energy industry in the US faces tough competition from developers in China.Mr Obama also acknowledged the loans would not be an instant solution.http://www.bbc.co.uk/"

PREG	What does implantation spotting look like? I'm getting worried I might be pr...	this morning I went to the bathroom and there was nothing there. after I got to work I went to the bathroom and saw like a pea sized amount of light pink something in my undies. and when I wiped there was a little smear of light pink. yesterday I woke up with really sore nipples, but not sore breasts. what is strange about is that I never have sore nipples, like ever. I also felt a strange lump I've never felt before on the right side of my right breast. I've also woken up with a strange metallic taste in my mouth a few times. my period isn't due until next week, but a little over a week ago I had what felt very similar to period cramps, just a little milder. I have also woken up feeling sick, I have even gotten sick a once or twice but blamed on light drinking the night before. sometimes when I pee I feel a light pain in the lower right side of my abdomen.I've been complaining about my different symptoms to my mom, and she's is starting to think I sound pregnant and I'm getting really worried.What I might also add is that I have been on birth control for over 3 years but earlier this month was put on antibiotics for a bacterial infection.Based on what I've said does it sound like I should begin to worry? Does it sound like I experienced implantation spotting?I already have a ob appointment scheduled for 2 pm tomorrow, and I'm gonna request a blood pregnancy test. I just want to get some opinions from other people who have first hand experienced this.

FAML	5 year old tantrums	"My 5 year old nephew has always had ""meltdowns"" but they are becoming daily. He is on the verge of being kicked out of school due to his behavior.    He kicks and hits the teachers and principal almost daily. These fits are brought on by nothing more than another child turning out the light at the end of the day, when he wanted to. All the other triggers are just as minimal. He also refuses at times to use the bathroom when it is obvious he has to go, and sometimes soils his pants. Loud noises seem to bother him, he will cover his ears with his hands. He is very smart and his parents are loving and supportive, but at their wits end. They want to have him evaluated to see if he has a disorder or if he is just a brat they need to be tough with. Most doctors just want to medicate him......what do you think?"

DEMO	SOS... PLEASE HELP ME ...I DON'T FEEL INTELLIGENT RIGHT NOW.	I have a 24 days cycle. My LMP was on Tuesday December 29th 2009 (12/29/09).I was told my High Fertility day was on Sunday January 3rd 2010 (01/03/10)And my Ovulation Days are from Monday January, 4th 2010 to Sunday January, 10th 2010 (01/04/10 Ã¢ € “ 01/10/10).We started having intercourse on my supposedly High Fertility day (01/03/10) and plan on doing such thru my ovulation days (01/04/10 Ã¢ € “ 01/10/10)Will this increase our chance of getting pregnant? We have been trying to get pregnant for 6 months now and it not fun anymore.I am an only child, so is my husband. However I had an 8 years old from my previous marriage. My husband on the other end never married before and has no child.    He loves my child dearly but we long thought that having a child together will be a joyful and great experience. We both love children, we are desperate to have one together, we would like to break the Ã¢ € œonly childÃ¢ €  myth thatÃ¢ € ™s both in each of our family (my parents are only children so are his parents). My son is crying for a sibling and my in laws would love to have a grand child before they are no longer among us.My first child came along with no difficulties, no calculations but this time it is nerves wrecking to have my second.    Please help me understand these confusing calculations about fertility and ovulation. Thank you.
TRMT	estreva gel 0.1%	Hello to all and Happy New Year.I had a hysterectomy some 12 years ago at age 29 and have been menopaused since then.    I have given up on HRT as i never found the 'right' medicine that works for me.Today, i have Hashimoto's which is a form of hypothyroid and my endocrinologist has strongly advised me to take HRT.    I had already tried Estreva gel 0.1% last year, but coincidentally, when i first started applying the gel as advised, i had terrible abdominal cramps (like labour cramps) and stopped the medicine after a few days of pain.    My OB/GY told me there was NO WAY Estreva gel could be the problem and that anyway i couldn't possibly have abdominal cramps as i haven't got a uterus anymore.    Confusing, but still, i never took the medicine again........ and the pain was gone.    To this day, i still don't know if i just had a stomach bug or if the cramps were a side effect from taking Estreva.I have been taking Estreva, again, for 3 weeks now (since my endocrinologist strongly advised me to and reassured me that it would be ok!).    First 2 weeks on a low dose and i was fine besides tender breasts for a few days.    I have increased the dose on the 3rd week (29th December) and started having the most painful lower back pain on 31st December.    I can barely move, it feels like i pulled my back muscles but i know i didn't, it radiates to my sides (almost like constipation pain but i'm not constipated) and down to my legs; no over-the-counter pain killers help.    I have VERY sensitive kidneys and i cannot tell if it's my lower back or my kidneys hurting so bad.    One thing for sure: Estreva gel is the only new medicine i'm taking and nothing else has changed in my diet and medicine taking.I would like to know if any of you have had similar problems with this medicine.    The information i found on the gel doesn't mention anything about back pain but we're human so it could still be.    I'm confused and not even sure i should go to the GP as i have NO IDEA if the two are related.Thank you for your help.    Anyone suffered the exact same problems with this medicine?
DISE	worried	I had my yearly mammo this past week. got a call from my dr office saying i need another and a ultrasound. I am 45 years old never had to return for a follow up. the nurse said its 7mm about the size of grain of rice. and for me not to worry. I go back in 2 weeks. the nurse said that sence i had my mammo durning my period and that i drink caffeine this could be the reason.

So now I am freaking out what the 7mm dense nodular could be! its going to be a long 2 weeks. ANY advise would be much welcome!!!
GOAL	Swollen Left Arm	I just started lifting again 4 days ago for the first time in months. I worked out my biceps mainly. Over the next 2 days, my muscles were sore as expected. However, on the 4th day, i noticed my left bicep swollen, and bigger than it was the day before. The muscle is still sore, and part of my forearm is also swollen a considerable amount. These swellings are only on my left arm, even though I used the same weight/reps/sets for each arm. Is this cause for concern? How should i treat it, and how long will it take to heal?

SOCL	vagina became dry very suddenly	I was having sex with my boyfriend, and everything was fine and normal. However, 2 hours later when we tried to do it again, my vagina was completely dry, and even after stimulating/more foreplay it still remained dry. This is strange because I usually have no problems with natural lubrication, and in most cases I am usually too wet - but this time it was different.Does anyone know why this could have happened? I have recently started taking the birth control pill, but I've only been on it for 4 weeks, so I don't think it should have had that much effect...
GOAL	Toric lens implant or LRI with pseudoexfoliation	I am having cataract surgery in my right eye which also has astigmatism of 1 diopter and pseudoexfoliation.    My doctor recommends    a Toric lens implant    to correct the astigmatism.    He says the likelihood that I will not need    glasses for distance is 80-90% with aToric lens implant but only 50% with an LRI.    I am concerned that future weakness of the zonules will cause a Toric Lens to rotate requiring more surgery.    How successful is an LRI with this amount of astigmatism?    Am I overly concerned about dislocation from the pseudoexfoliation?

GOAL	broken foot	I hurt my foot jumping off a steeplechase barrier during cross country practice 5 days ago and forced myself to walk on it over the next few days until i got an xray and was told it was broken- a displaced fracture in the 5th metatarsal. I have been aqua jogging every day since and strength and conditioning exercising but i still feel its not working me hard enough. I am a runner and am terrified of my losing my fitness. Is there anything I can do to make my pool workouts harder without swimming, and is there any other non weight bearing exercises I can do? Also is there anything I should include in my diet which may help speed the recovery process as i'm not sure if I can cope with these crutches much longer, my other leg is starting to hurt now.

SOCL	Arizona Court Rules That You Could Get A DUI If You Smoked Pot Three Weeks Ago	As anyone whoÃ¢ € ™s ever smoked marijuana knows, getting a job, even weeks after smoking a single joint (or part of a joint), can be daunting. Many, if not most employers now require drug tests. In Arizona, even driving to the job interview can be risky. According to an Arizona appeals court ruling, you might now be guilty of a DUI even if you arenÃ¢ € ™t currently under the influence. You could be guilty of a DUI if you even have residual marijuana in your system, which can remain for weeks. From StopTheDrugWar.org:The ruling in Arizona v. Shilgevorkyan overturned a decision by a superior court judge who said that it didnÃ¢ € ™t make sense to prosecute people for driving under the influence if theyÃ¢ € ™re not actually under the influence.The appeals court disagreed, citing its decisions on earlier challenges to the DUID. Ã¢ € œThe legislature intended to create a Ã¢ € ˜per se prohibitionÃ¢ € ™ and a Ã¢ € ˜flat banÃ¢ € ™ on driving with any proscribed drug in oneÃ¢ € ™s system,Ã¢ €  the court noted. Ã¢ € œWe determined that the legislative ban extends to all substances, whether capable of causing impairment or not.Ã¢ € Because the law was drafted to protect public safety, the appeals court said, it should be interpreted broadly to include inactive as well as active compounds.Opponents of the ruling argue that the law unfairly punishes medical marijuana users in the state, especially if they arenÃ¢ € ™t driving under the influence. It also discourages tourists, especially from nearby states like Colorado, which has legalized marijuana, and California, which also has legal medical marijuana.Determining if a driver is driving while impaired from marijuana is a challenge for law enforcement. There is currently no standard to determine how much THC is too much THC, so cops basically guess. They do rely on blood tests, but even then, safe levels of THC vary from person to person. Some police departments use a series of eye tests to determine if a driver is currently stoned. HereÃ¢ € ™s a video:Ultimately, as legal marijuana use becomes more and more prevalent, it will probably be up to the Supreme Court to determine what is reasonable and what is not when a driver is suspected of being high. ShilgevorkyanÃ¢ € ™s attorney plans on taking his case to the Arizona state Supreme Court.http://www.addictinginfo.org/2013/02/16/arizona-court-rules-that-you-could-get-a-dui-if-you-smoked-pot-three-weeks-ago-video/

My doctor said that I had some abnormal cells, they did the biopsy and it came back fine.

GOAL	Cylindrical Power	Hello,As stated in my earlier post last year, my daughter has cylindrical power, however after wearing glasses now nearly for more than a year, her cylindrical power has reduce from -2.5 (both eyes) to -1.5 (right) and -0.5 (left). However she does have starbismus when she wakes up from her sleep for say 5 minutes and when she is extremely tired. We have been patching her eyes for the past 8 months.Yes, definitely she has a fair control and adjusts her eyes when she is out from the sleepy mode and when she is active seldom do we see signs of starbismus. Like a Therapy, she is now prescribed glasses with an additional spherical power (artificial), so that she can adjust her eyes quickly. My questions are:1. How long does she need to wear glasses?2. How long do we need to continue patching? Also, what is the reason that she has the starbismus only when she is tired?3. Does she require any kind of surgery in this regard and can it be cured completely over a span of time?Thanks & RegardMaverickThis discussion is related toCylindrical Eye power for 2 year old kid.

GOAL	Face pain with sores on hard palate	For the past 3 days I have had numbness and pain on the left side of my face, primarily around the eye, cheekbone and cheek.    One day after this pain began I developed a mouth ulcer on the left side of my hard palate.    I have no symptoms of sinus infection (absolutely no congestion), no eye tearing, no symptoms of a palsy.    My left eye hurts a little when I blink, my face hurt to touch and the pain stops on the left side of my nose.    A couple of years ago I developed a similar feeling of numbness and tingling on one side of my face, from my scalp across the left side down to my neck.    At that time I went to the ER to have a stroke ruled out.    Those symptoms resolved after about 3 days and have returned periodically (2-3 times a year).    This time seems to be a little worse, with more pain and the mouth ulcers.    I have racked my brain (and the internet) trying to figure out what's up.    Any ideas?    Thanks for your help

Most of my friends and family tell me I'm amazing and they could never do what I do but I feel like I don't have a choice because my kids mean the world to me and I'm the sole provider.My doctor precribed my with Effexor Xr 75mg's to help control my bouts of depression and anxiety. Since I've been on it I've gained about 20 pounds and I am now smoking full time. (I used to smoke only socially). I have contant cravings for food, cigarettes and sometimes alcohol. The other problem I'm having is that my menstrual periods have been very irregular. I'm bleeding in between cycles and having alot of cramping. I can't get in to see my doctor for a few more weeks, but I'm considering switching to Wellbutrin (based on what I've read) to control the weight gain and cravings.I feel that I need to stay on medication for a while to handle my emotions, but now I'm worried about other health issues. I'm wondering if anyone else out there has experienced anything similar?

PREG	Contraceptive implant and side effects?	I had the contraceptove implant put in 2 weeks ago today, 3 days before my expected period. I had it inserted because I wasn't getting along with the contraceptive pill as I fell pregnant and miscarried and it made me extremely ill. However, I'm finding that the contraceptive implant is near enough having the same effects on me that the contraceptive pill had done.I was pre-warned that I had to wait at least 7 days for it to be effective. I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend on the 6th/7th day, and several times after that. I'm not questioning pregnancy, but the side effects are atrocious.My periods have stopped, but the nausea, lower abdominal cramping and headaches have all returned just like I experienced with the contraceptive pill.Are the side effects supposed to be this bad? The cramping is absolute agony, even brought me to tears a few times.Should I just stick with it, or have it removed?Any advice helps!Thank you!

DISE	Hudroceles, Brown Semen, and Now High Levels of Creatinine	Hello Doctor.    I am writing this in regards to my husband. About    7 months ago my husband started having testicular pain after he ejaculated. He went to our doctor and they ran a gammit of tests and treated him for hydroceles. After about 10 days or so, the pain ceased and he had no more issues since. Now about 2 weeks ago, him and I finished having sex and we noticed that the color of his semen was brown in color. Instantly we became concerned, but he was apprehensive and decided to wait a week or two to see if it cleared up on its own. Alot of medical online jouranls stated that it could be caused by a variety of non-threatening circumstances and that if it didn'tgo away on its own, then you should seek medical attention. Now just yesterday we received his results for a 10-panel drug screen test. We have been in a long drawn-out court battle to gain full custody and he voluntarily submitted to a drug screen. The test came back negative on everything including alcohol, but what was concerning was the level of creatinine that was detected. 175 mg/dl. Now everything that I have looked up online states that this is WAY beyond the normal range. Do you believe there is a correlation between all these events? And what do you believe is the actual underlying cause of all of this?Thank you.

SOCL	Study: More than half of Americans feel negative financial impacts from recession	"(CNN) -- Before the economic recession hit in 2007, Lana Melnik was a college counselor at Northeastern University in Massachusetts guiding hundreds of students towards employment.Now, at 57, she's been laid off from her school, and she is taking temporary stints as a substitute teacher until she secures a full-time job.""My friends are asking me, ""How are you still managing?"" Melnik said. ""I tell them I'm still standing.""And she's not alone.More than 55 percent of adults in the U.S. labor force are feeling the impact of unemployment or wage and work hour reductions since the economic downturn began 2 Ã‚ ½ years ago, according to a broad report from the Pew Research Center's Social and Demographic Trends Project.""This recession has left a mark on a lot of things,"" says Paul Taylor, project director at the Pew Research Center. ""It's changed behaviors and it's changed expectations.""The study, which is based on the interviews of 3,000 Americans by telephone in May and on federal economic and demographic data, found the economy is taking a financial toll on many American families. The length of unemployment has surged, averaging about six months, the report said. This six-month period surpasses the previous record average length of unemployment in the 1982 to 1983 recession, which was about three months.Read about the stigma of unemploymentShrinking and disappearing paychecks have put strains on family finances. One out of two adults surveyed said their finances are suffering more since the recession started, the study said. Only 20 percent say they are in better financial shape since the recession began.With less disposable income, the recession has caused American families to rethink their spending habits, the study finds. About six out of ten Americans reported tightening their spending habits. About a third surveyed said they will continue being frugal with expenses even when the recession is over. But a majority say they plan to revert to their pre-recession spending habits.And if American families are looking to find money in their homes, they are likely to find bad news in the short term. About 48 percent of homeowners surveyed said the value of their home dropped during the recession. Of those who believe their house is worth less, nearly half believe it will take three to five years for the value of their home to recover from the recession.But despite the shrinking value, the vast majority of those polled say owning a home is the best long term investment.The groups taking the biggest hit from the economic downturn -- blacks and young adults -- are more upbeat about a recovery than are whites and older adults. The survey also found Democrats to have a more positive view than Republicans.Retirement is a vexing issue for many Americans, who have dipped into their savings and assets to survive, Pew Center experts said. About 32 percent of adults fear they will not have enough money to retire, an increase from 25 percent in February 2009.The survey also posed an long-term question to the adults about the future of their children. About 25 percent surveyed said they think their children will have a worse standard of living than they experienced, up from ten percent of Americans expressing that view a decade ago. However, blacks, Hispanics and young adults hold a more positive view of intergenerational progress than whites and older adults.Other findings of the study are encouraging, Pew researchers point out. About 62 percent of Americans believe their personal finances will improve in the coming year."
FAML	My 6 yr old son is afraid of everything!	My 6 yr old son is afraid of everything. He won't go be in a room by himself even if I'm right next door. He follows me around constantly because he is afraid to be alone. He talks about ghosts a lot. He's not ADD or on any medication. He is driving me crazy with these fears. I can't even go to the bathroom without him most of the time because he's so afraid. What should I be doing? I've talked to him about his fears and the ghosts. I've asked him to describe them and he usually describes things he's seen on tv. I try not to let him watch even cartoons that may have ghosts in them but it hasn't helped. What should I do with him? I'm so afraid he's missing out on things already because of his fears.

TRMT	Food safety and health alert	"In case you missed it, the FDA cited a food processing plant in Yakima, Washington called Snokist for moldy applesauce.    This company is a food supplier for the government school lunch programs.    An article I just read had even more deplorable description of the facility than what was reported in the nightly news.    Absolutely disgusting the descriptions I read about the condition the facility has been in while it is processing this stuff as food that goes across the entire country.    I'm shocked that I am not reading anything about recalls of this ""food"".    I don't care how hot the vats are that the applesauce get, I'm not interested in eating something that they skim the mold off of and get away with calling it food.    I have enough food sensitivities without aggravating the problems by allowing toxic mold to get cooked into the apple sauce--along with reading about the conditions I read in the article I will post the link to shortly.If any of us were to make our own homemade apple sauce, we would never use apples that were obviously moldy.    We would have the good sense to throw out the apples that were so unfit for consumption, because we know it isn't safe.    We would use the freshest and cleanest fruit we had on hand.I just thought it was too important not to alert other people of this serious issue in the food supply.    This isn't right to do, because that mold can't be good for anyone who already has compromised health, even if it is supposedly killed     by the cooking process.    Plus, it would obviously change the flavor.    I'm definitely throwing out anything with that company name and any canned apple sauce with a not so well known brand name.    Supposedly none of it reached any food banks or schools, but how can they really be so sure, since the company was cited more than once in recent months and didn't really change its practices once the health inspectors went on their way and had their backs turned.    I won't be leaving the stuff I'm throwing out for anyone else to take for themselves, because I can't be sure it's safe.    This company has lost all points with me.    This is absolutely appalling to me.http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2011/11/fda-company-sent-moldy-applesauce-to-school-lunch-program/"

SOCL	Impact of CT Scan on the veins	"I recently had a CT scan and the IV was inserted into my hand.    The technician said that this is much more painful than an arm insertion because it ""expands the veins"" and there is less fat in the hand.    This was nerly a week ago and for two days after the test, I had very, very limited use of my whole forearm and now 6 days later continue to have protruding veins in my hand and up past my wrist as well as residual pain (especially when I let that arm fall to my side).

SOCL	Tea Party Threatens Revenge	Against Pennsylvania Justices For Not Upholding Voter ID LawEarlier this week, every single sitting Pennsylvania Supreme Court justice rejected a lower court decision allowing that stateÃ¢ € ™s voter ID law to take effect. Four justices joined a majority opinion requiring the lower court judge to look at the case again due to concerns that voters were unable to obtain the IDs they were supposed to have easy access to as a matter of law, and two more justices joined a dissent arguing that the law should simply be suspended right away. Three of the justices in the majority were Republicans.Nevertheless, a Tea Party group is now threatening to exact revenge upon the state supreme court for refusing to uphold a law that prevents many low-income, student and minority voters from casting a ballot:A Philadelphia-area tea party group says it will work to defeat two state Supreme Court justices next year if the stateÃ¢ € ™s new voter identification law isnÃ¢ € ™t in effect for the Nov. 6 election.The Independence Hall Tea Party on Thursday also criticized the courtÃ¢ € ™s decision to send a legal challenge to the law back for a lower court review.It called the decision Ã¢ € œa cowardly moveÃ¢ €  to Ã¢ € œpunt the ball.Ã¢ € Chief Justice Ronald Castille, a Republican, and Justice Max Baer, a Democrat, are each finishing a 10-year term in January 2014.These kinds of campaigns of vengeance against justices who place the law ahead of conservativeÃ¢ € ™s policy preferences are increasingly common. Two years ago, a Florida Tea Party group launched a similar revenge campaign after the Florida Supreme Court kept an unconstitutional ballot initiative attempting to nullify the Affordable Care Act off the state ballot. Similarly, anti-gay groups poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into a successful effort to remove three Iowa supreme court justices because they had the audacity to recognize that the stateÃ¢ € ™s constitution does not permit discrimination against gay couples.As a recent Center for American Progress report explains, corporate interest groups have also spent big money to stack state judiciaries with friendly judges and justices. In one of the most egregious cases, a West Virginia coal baron spent $3 million to buy a seat on the state supreme court for a justice who later went on to strike down a $50 million verdict against his company, although the U.S. Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the bought-and-paid-for justice should have recused himself.http://thinkprogress.org/justice/2012/09/21/887711/tea-party-threatens-revenge-against-pennsylvania-justices-for-not-upholding-voter-id-law/?mobile=nc

PREG	Should I change Formulas?	My DD is 7 weeks today.    She started out on Simalac and she was real fussy and having some projectile vamiting so Dr. said it could be an allergy so she told me to try soy so I tryed Good Start soy and she was very gassy so she said try Neutremigen because that is what my first DD was on.    She has been on that since 3 weeks old.    She still has her colicy symptoms.    She sleeps good but when she is awake most of the time she is crying.    She acts like she is starving even after you feed her and she is very hard to burb and having gas even with gas drops and she still vomits a few times a week.    A friend told me her DS had the same problem she put him on Simalac with low iron and he was totaly diffrent.

DEMO	Severe PMS symptoms - should I consider a hysterectomy?	I'm 35.    A year ago I had a blood test for thyroid.    My thyroid was fine, so my doctor suggested I go to an OB/GYN and ask about PCOS, as my glucose was slightly elevated (102) & I am obese.    Also, my periods were slightly irregular, but only by a few days.    They may start a little early or late, but I have never missed a period.The nurse practitioner didn't think I had PCOS, as I had no missed periods, hair loss/increase, acne, etc.    However, she did say I might be eligible for a hysterectomy because of severe PMS symptoms & heavy flow, since I'm not trying to get pregnant.My periods are extremely heavy - I use about 1 tampon/hour for the first 2 days & I get very fatigued.    The NP thinks I may be anemic during my period, & I have a standing order for a blood test when I get my cycle.Also, PMS for me is 2+ weeks of severe cramping, anxiety/depression, headaches, muscle aches, fatigue, & I often catch some cold or flu as though my immune system has conked out.However, I just don't want to have a hysterectomy.    I would, however, like some relief from the PMS and other monthly problems I have.    They've gotten worse as I've gotten older - I only have maybe one week a month where I feel normal.What other options do I have?    I can't take birth control pills (it raises my blood pressure) and the NP didn't mention other treatments.    She's supposed to call me in a day or two.    What can I ask her, and what treatments can I mention to her when she calls?

TRMT	I get really tired when I eat	I find myself getting really tired sometimes when I eat, I just feel horribly drained and can barely keep my eyes open, most times I can't fight it and end up taking a nap. It's getting to the point where some days I'm in bed more than I'm awake, which I know is obviously not good for me. I find it usually happens when I eat pasta or soup with crackers, so I'm guessing it's sugar/carbs related.

Is there anything I can do to stop this from happening?

DISE	Short break	I am taking a day or two off.    My mom is increasingly short of breath and we found out last night (Yes, her PCP called her last night at home!)    She has fairly large pleural effusions (collection of fluid in the chest cavity outside the lungs).    This is restricting the spece she has to expand her lungs for breathing.    She will need to have it tapped off, both for relief (though it would likely come back) and for diagnosis.    The three likely causes are infection (but no symptoms of that), autoimmune (again no other symptoms) and cancer ( :(( )    I am very worried.

DISE	Someone plz read and help me!!!	"I am 26yo and was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism about 3yrs ago. That was a very dark period in my life because I had been going through all kinds of moodswings and irritability. I was in and out of hospitals and doctor offices, only to be told that I had anxiety. At first I thought I did because I was very stressed out but the way I was acting, I knew that it wasn't my normal self. I really wish that I could explain how hopeless and clueless and sad I felt. Life seemed really cold and dark to me, I became deeply depressed. It seemed like I had no one to turn to.I remember one day I was sitting down at home on the computer and all of a sudden, my heart started beating so fast. I immediately called 911 because I thought that I was having a heart attack (I didn't know at the time that your heart stops beating if it's a heart attack because I was clueless about what it was) I was scared out of my mind. Anyway, I was taken to the ER and to make a long story short, they was so interested in me taking drugs tests instead of trying to help calm my nerves and fears. From what I remember, my heart beats were about 160. As I now am aware, that's kinda high, but I remember a nurse telling me that day that at my age I could handle it. I remember pulling off those chest stickers and walked out.If only I had known better, I would have stayed and let them (if they would have) run some thorough tests to see what the problem was, I would probably have saved myself more suffering and feel better today.So, to fast forward to today. I eventually ended up receiving a RAI 131 scan to confirm hyperthyroid. The results said that after 24 hours, I had an uptake of 83%, which confirmed Graves diseases. I was put on Methimazole, which made me itch all over and become more irritated. I then started taking Benadryl, which made me so tired. My life was a mess. I couldn't function for school or work. I'm telling you, this disease had (and still do)me on some kind of bodily roller coaster.The doctor that I have been seeing for this condition is not an endocrinologist and had little knowledge of this condition. It's unfortunate that I had no way to see an endocrinologist because my insurance don't cover ""specialty"" care. However, I'm at the point that I'm willing to go into debt because of my health. Right now, I'm really interested in a natural approach to stopping this dis-ease.I really hope someone has taken the time to read what I wrote up to this point but if not, I will not stop trying to get to the bottom of what's causing my condition. I know that it doesn't run in my family and so, it had to be something wrong I did internally. I've read that stress could trigger this condition, and it makes me wonder if it's the reason as I was robbed not even a year before my symptoms surfaced. I have also had a root canal done, which have been giving me problems since.Some info about what medications I taking now is Methamizole 10mg about 4 times a day. My TSH is 0.05, T4 is 8.5, T3 is 0.93--I try to limit meals with too much sodium and drink plenty of water. Oh, and eat more fruits and veggies. I really don't know what else to do besides this.Someone please give me some kind of advice about what to do, or referrals to holistic, natural doctors that have expertise with this condition. Please!Here are some of my lab results up to this point:9-24-2007 TSH ~0.01 (Sadly, my first primary care doctor never told me about an abnormal reading when I was tested prior to this one. She said because of my age, she thought I'd work itself out)12-27-2007 TSH~0.05, Free T4~1.359-04-2009 TSH~0.05, T4~ 8.0, T3~0.93, WBC~ 9.86, RBC~ 5.55, HGB~ 15.1, PLATELET COUNT 2529-20-2009 TSH~ 0.05, T3~PENDING, T4~ 8.5, GLUCOSE 78"

DEMO	Monistat not working after 7 days of YI! PLEASE HELP!!	i keep getting reacuring yeast infections each month. i am unemployed and only have medicaid share of cost but cant afford the share of cost (imagine that.) i have seen a couple doctors and they all tell me that they just find a little bit a yeast. i'm miserable and moody now because i just can't seem to figure out what the problem is. it seems as if it all started after my second miscarrage(miscarriage)4 months ago. i am extremly itchy and uncomfortable! it does not burn when i pee but after takeing monistat day 1 treatment it has been burning after i wipe after peeing. i had no discharge until after useing monistat day 1 treatmnt. i have read that many women have problems with monistat day one so i'm not sure what to do now. i think i made the problem worse...it feels worse. i can not afford another $20-$30 over the counter treatments anymore. i spend almost $50 a month on them. i'm sooo tired of feeling this way and VERY sexually frustrated. doctors have mentioned laposcopy as the last options knowing that endometriosis runs in my family. the problem is that i dont have a regular doc anymore so the others just do the same testing and want me to keep comeing back. i can not afford any more doctors visits nor monistat so i was desperate and turned to home remedies which has worked somtimes before when i got a yeast infection. i have tryed sea salt in bath water, apple syder viniger in the bath water, tons of garlic cloves, tea tree oil and Azo yeast pills. NOTHING is working AT ALL!!! i took monistat 7 days ago and left my body alone for 4 days until my infection seemd to be getting worse is when i tryed home remidies. i have also used my prescription topical cream the doc prescribed from the last yeast infection, it help last time but NOT a all this time! they have given me diflucin    think its called 2 times last month but i'm not sure if i works. i'm miserable and ran out of my options. the only doc now that acepts medicaid can't see me for another month and my original doc no longer takes medicaid :( there had been no change in my diet, eating the same as before all this. not sure if i've been tested for diabetes before but i'm sure i would know if i had diabeties. i was just tested for STD's last month (which was the clinic that prescribed me my topical cream and deflican) negative HIV and negative everything except for hepitis A but he said thats good that i tested possitive for that but that it wasnt good that i tested negativ for another type of hepititis(hepatitis)B. he suggested a vaccine saying that i could easliy catch it next time it comes around and that he sees that i had it before but must have been treated for it. to my recognition i have never been told i had hepitits nor have been treated with shot like he explaind.last month i had a normal period not very heavy and went by quick but 2 weeks later i started bleeding again 2 days of regular bleeding and 5 days of spotting. this month my period was due on the 7th it is now the 14th and no period. tested 3 different time with a home pregnancy test and all 3 negatives. is there anyone out there that knows of any other method i could try? and what could be going on? the doctors these days seem to realy just want to push u out the door just telling u anything and everything to put u at easy but nevr seem to get down to the problem. i want a laposcopy done because i know there is something wrong and my mother has had endometriosis so i'm thinking it is that. i do not know how to request a laposcopy to my new doc i wil see in a month, she will just want to do the same tests just to see for her self what the cause is. but i'm sooo tired of doing the same **** i want to get to the bottom of it. im not sure if medicaid will cover laposcopy if i suggest it and if it is not needed in the docs eyes.is there anything else i can try until my doc appointment. is vagisil the same thing? any advice would be much appreciated! thanks for reading
PREG	Cramps but no period?	I have had pretty bad cramps for 5 days now. I was supposed to start my    period on Friday, it's now Tuesday and still nothing.    I have the cramps like I am on my    period and keep checking    for the bleeding but still nothing.    I don't know whats going and I keep thinking I could be pregnant. But why do I still have the cramps?    I don't have sore breasts or any other symptom, just the bad cramping.
GOAL	poor vision	Good evening to all, I am having some vision problems issues and cannot get the proper correction from my glasses. My right eye is around 20/40 corrected with some distortion from a detached retina in 4/10; cataract removed and replaced with a Toric lens and a macular membrane peel in 12/10.        My left eye is about 20/25 corrected with three retinal tears fixed with the laser and a small cataract. Each eye tested independently is really not that bad, but getting both eyes to work together seems to be the big problem. I am experiencing a lot of cloudiness and blurred vision particularly during the day and at distances. My reading vision is not as bad. I am being followed by an outstanding Retinal surgeon and was told at my last visit two weeks everything looked fine with my retinas. I have had three different eyeglass prescriptions since June of this year. Is there anything else that might be tried to improve my overall vision? I was considering a neuro- ophthalmologist. Thank you for all of your help.

GOAL	Very severe pain flare ups tooth, sinus, jaw, neck....any thoughts?	A year ago, the filling in my upper right molar broke.    It's the tooth second from the back (not including wisdom tooth) that nerves run directly into the maxillary sinus.        When the filling broke, it was drilled out and a very large filling put in.        But after that procedure it was sore for a couple months.After this, I had an on and off low grade fever for many months and eventually a VERY severe pain developed in that tooth when biting,    pain in that right maxillary sinus,    and the pain spread back to my jaw, and below my jaw down my neck with swollen lymph nodes.However, surprisingly for me, the repeated bite wing x-rays did not reveal anything.     However, I took amoxicillin and the symptoms quickly went away after 5 days.        The symptoms didn't bother me except mildly on and off for several more months, but last week as I was exercising and lifting weights, I began to feel my heartbeat painfully in the tooth and the pain quickly onset again like before, very severe pain in the same areas...to my sinus, pain when biting,    pain in jaw and neck with swollen lymph nodes as before.The dentist who did the work dismissed any intervention due to the normal x-rays, and I was okay with that because the Amoxil got rid of the symptoms the first time, but this time it's not working completely to help my symptoms,    only 50% maybe by day 6 of Amoxil.Since I'm highly sensitive to many antibiotic side effects, I'm unsure of what to do.    Does this definitely sound like a tooth problem and would just having it pulled get rid of the pain for good?
DISE	Levels out of control?	My levels have been spiraling out of control.    12/05 3.41, 12/06 9.74, 2/07 11.401, then in 5/07 my tsh levels was 58.09. They had started me on synthroid as my numbers started to rise and as they increased my synthroid the numbers kept rising.     After starting on synthyroid, I began having numbness in my hands and feet at night, trouble sleeping and irratic emotions.    At the point my tsh was 58.09, I began having numbness/tingling throughout the day, dramatic change in skin and hair texture, extreme bloating and irratic moods.    I asked the doctor to take me off the synthetic version and we started Armour, the first month at the lower dose my numbers came down some to 53.? and so they increased the Armour dose, now tsh is over 60.3.    As we speak they are rechecking my bloodwork to get the t4 and t3 numbers.    Any suggestions of what to look for ?
DISE	severe and painful bladder spasms	Two days ago, I experienced extreme and painful (what I think) bladder spasms. These spasms or contractions occured every 40 seconds and lasted for about 10 seconds. The spasms were extremely painful, shooting to the left side of my left breast and into my cervix. It was excruciating. Massaging the area only made it worse, it was only after an hour of placing hot packs and taking a painkiller (Nurofen 200 mg) that the spasms subsided, although I can still feel slight spasms.I have a mass growing on the outside of the bladder and is believed by doctors to be endometriosis. Since I am trying to conceive (at age 35), my fertility specialist has suggested to hold of on any surgery to remove this mass and focus on getting pregnant.I was wondering if I should seek medical help and whether I would need to reconsider the urgency of having this mass removed.Any suggestions?
DISE	Subclinical Hypothyroidism	I was recently diagnosed with Hypothyroidism. Subclinical Hypothyroidism to be exact.    I have a few questions that I hope you guys can answer.    I've read a really long thread that I found my the search engine that convinced me to sign up.    You guys seem very informative.    Hope you can help me.They want to put me on Levothyroxine which I'm against.    I am a believer in natural stuff so I mentioned I take Armour.    They told me to think about it.    They told me all the stuff I've read about.    That it's unrealiable.    That you get too much etc.    I'm suppose to be getting another thyroid test hopefully soon (to see if it's changed) and then they are going to determine a course of action.    I told them that I went on a strict diet in 2005.    That I started drinking Soy milk and lots of soy related products.    My hair started looking dull in March of 06.    I got sick in April with a fever and my hair started falling out like crazy.Once I started eating meat and protein again, the hair stopped falling out (8 months later) but hasn't full recovered.    I'm convinced the Soy Milk is what caused the thyroid issue as no one in my family has these health issues.    I developed sweating issues and once off the soy milk this past September, their nearly non existant.    I don't know if the continued sweating (hardly bad) is from the thyroid or if its from certain food that has soy in it.    It's hard to avoid.    I try to eat organic and watch what I eat.Everyone in my family has a full head of my hair.    They checked my testosterone and since it's normal, they now think the hair loss is because of the thyroid.    Can't these doctors make up their mind?    In the beginning he told me that his boss recommends Armour but he doesn't.    Now a couple months later he's telling that his boss doesn't.    What's going on here?    Is he that desperate to get me on a synthetic drug?    He wants me to think about Levothyroxine.I've also read that in some cases, the subclinical kind can go away on it's own.    I'm thinking that being off the soy milk will definately help it but I've read that it can take 3 months to get the toxicity of the soy out of my system.    Maybe even longer depending on how long I took it for.    I'm so desperate to get things moving here.    I've been a bug on the wall for 3 years.    Tired, exhausted, insomnia, sweating issues, tremors, heart palps. It's crazy stuff.I'm very confused about the dosage talk about these pills.    I've read that it's better to split the pill in half and take half in the morning and half around supper.    I have a high TSH (7.02) but I believe my T3 and T4 are normal.    I would like to know how all this works.    What exactly has to be done to make the TSH go down?    What do I need to watch out for?    How long does it take to work?    Anything else you think I should would be appriciated.ThanksSean
PREG	Gestation Diabetes & High Iron Levels	Hey everyone...Congratulations to all of us on our pregnancies - 1st, 2nd, 3rd, or more! hahahaI'm wondering if anyone else has had their 3 hour glucose test yet, or if anyone else has been diagnosed with GD this early in a pregnancy. My OBGYN called and left a VOICEMAIL on my phone Friday night and told me A) I have GD, and B) my iron levels are too high so i can't take my prenatal vitamins anymore. I'm completely unimpressed that he did that and totally left me hanging as everything is closed for the weekend! I can't get any questions answered, any clarification, nothing. I don't know what to do, what not to do, how to eat, etc. I have a lovely friend on here who gave me some tips that i'm very grateful for that, but I'm hoping someone else can help me out too - the more information the better I would think!    He said I should be expecting a phone call from the diabetes nurse but I don't know when and most things are closed between Christmas and New Years around here too so unless they squeeze me in this week I'll be waiting until January at the earliest to see anyone about this!    This has me very upset which is definitely not good for baby!Also, the high iron levels, has anyone ever experienced that? I haven't been taking my prenatal vitamins since he phoned and have been taking 5mg of folic acid and some vitamin d that I had already been taking on top of my prenatal but I don't know what other vitamins I should be taking. The beginning of the pregnancy is so important I don't want anything to end badly because i didn't get the right vitamins or nutrients! Any help would be greatly appreciated!
SOCL	Implantation Spotting ?	I have irregular periods, caused by PCOS (usually 28-35 day cycles) About 4 days ago I noticed a tiny pink spot when I wiped. 2 days later I noticed a bit more, only this time it was more red/dark pink along with very mild cramping. I thought my period had come but that night I only had a few drops of brown blood. The mild cramping turned into slight aching in my lower stomach (often near my left ovary), and watery clear discharge. With my first pregnancy I remember having pretty bad cramps about a week before I found out, but now I have pretty much no discomfort, no breast pain, no nothing. If this was my period I'm sure it would have started full force by now.Would implantation cause symptoms/spotting like this, even though I have little to no other pregnancy symptoms? When should I test?

SOCL	How do I gain my fiancÃƒÂ©Ã¢Â€Â™s trust again after lying to him?	I recently got engaged to my boyfriend who i have been dating for almost 3 years now. We are getting married in 2 monthsÃ¢ € ™ time. Everything was going well and i was busy shopping and preparing for the big day! I travelled to another town for shopping with my mom over the weekend. I needed to get back for work on Monday while mom was gonna stay longer. My fiancÃƒ © did not want me to travel alone as he is very protective about me.    So i lied to him saying i had a friend coming with me. The lie was very trivial and only so that he does not worry too much about me. However he knows me in and out. And figured by the way i was talking that there was something fishy. So i accepted that i lied and told him everything. This has hurt him a lot as he trusted me blindly and changed the way he looks at me. He doesnÃ¢ € ™t want to trust me anymore and does not care. (At least he says so) He has a tendency of saying mean things to make me realize my mistakes. He is also fed up of giving me chances as I have been and done stupid things in the past. This situation has screwed up any excitement regarding the wedding. I desperately want things to be ok. But i know that it ll take time. How can i handle this situation in the best way. I ve already apologized and promised that i would never lie again.
DISE	Crushed Foot	i crushed my foot on november of 2008 between a motorized pallet jack and a metal rod while i was driving the pallet jack at work. the doctor said i had some fractures on my foot 1 on the heal 2 on the top of foot and 1 on the left side of my left foot where the ball is.    he just put a cast on it and sent me off. afterwards i did therapy but it was painful and kept swelling up. i told the doctor and he said push through it so i was released to go back to work but the pain and swelling was still there and it would get real red.    doctor took me off work again and more therapy but still same results. we tried RSD but the doctor he sent me to said i didnt have the symptoms.    finally he said he didnt know what else he could do for me and workers comp sent me to another doctor. i kept working through the pain and swelling. it would get real bad that i would limp and wouldnt want to put pressure on it. after a couple of years the doctor said i need a fusion on my foot. so after a my lawyer fought to get surgery done in 2011 i got the fusion. but still after a while of walking/standing/or anything with moving my toes it gets painful. it feels week i cant get on my tippy toes/squat/jump/run or play any sports with my kids really because it hurts. and the doctor says to just push through it but i been doing that for some years now. i did get a 2% impairment rating but thats not what i really want. i mean i wouldnt mine the money cuz my lawyer needs to get paid but ill be happy to just get my foot to almost normal. i cant keep a job cuz it swells and hurts and i limp like crazy. so the question i have is what can i do about this or am i stuck with the pain?                 sorry if i wrote to much to get to the question

DEMO	Questions:  Don't Want to be Pregnant!	"first of all let me describe my situation b/c i know people will immediately judge me.    i just need some ideas as to what is actually going on with my body.    I am in my mid 20's and a few months ago ended a long term relationship with someone.    i    was dating a man and having intercourse with him with a condom every single time, the whole time.    The dating and talking lasted a couple of months until I got reacquainted with a guy friend of 6 years.    we hung out, and had that instant attraction and knew we wanted to be together (monogamously).    the first night we hung out and the second night we became exclusive (both non-married and single).    our relationship has been wonderful ever since.    but, im worried, more than worried now. before my current boyfriend and i got together, i    possibly (not sure about the dates and period in august) had started to, one night, have intercourse with my exboyfriend, 1 time, no condom, but he has vasectomy, never finished b/c i didn't want to proceed.    i know for sure i had intercourse 2 times with the person i was dating non-exclusively but with a condom the entire time both times 5 days before i happened to wind up being with my wonderful boyfriend i have now.    my new boyfriend and i used a condom but had a mishap that resulted in it slipping off inside of me.    12 days after the condom mishap with my boyfriend, i went to the doctor for a urine pregnancy test, and a blood test which all came back negative.    now im close to 2 wks late for my period, which is not normal for me.    my boyfriend and i have been together for 24 days now, of course monogamously, and i am worried that i might be pregnant.    since then i have taken 2 home tests as well that came back negative.    i remember i had a period the july 18th, and i can't remember when mine was in august, but when would i ""normally"" get a period in september?    i have no breast tenderness, im tired b/c of my schedule, im not nauseous, no abnormal headaches, i am bloated and gassy, but i think that's my diet.    i know most of u think badly of me by now.    . :-(    surely if i were pregnant my new boyfriend would be the father??    i just don't know how i could tell the man that i have been such great friends with for so many years and that i have fallen for all of this.    after last period it was 1 time with ex with vasectomy, 2 times complete condom usage with person i was dating, and my new boyfriend and i haven't used a condom every time (pull out and finish with condom).    1 doc urine test, 2 hpt's, and 1 blood test later, all negative.    any ideas????btw, when all this is said and done, im getting an IUD.    i worry sooo much...."

Obama admitted he faced stiff opposition from gun rights advocates in Congress and vowed executive action in the face of any legislative logjam.One month to the day after the elementary school slaughter in Connecticut, the president said he had received recommendations from Vice President Joe Biden's task force for curbing a national epidemic of gun violence.""TheyÃ¢ € ™ve presented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw in Newtown doesnÃ¢ € ™t happen again,"" he told reporters.

Ã¢ € œI donÃ¢ € ™t know,Ã¢ €  acknowledged Obama, who was due to discuss the issue with Biden later on Monday.Ã¢ € œMy starting point is not to worry about the politics. My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works, what should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that weÃ¢ € ™re reducing the incidence of gun violence,"" the president said. Ã¢ € œI think we can do that in a sensible way that comports with the 2nd amendment.Ã¢ € Obama also warned congressional Republicans on Monday that he will not trade spending cuts for their vote to raise the countryÃ¢ € ™s debt ceiling.Obama called Republican talk of not raising the limitÃ¢ € ”of, in effect, not paying the countryÃ¢ € ™s billsÃ¢ € ”Ã¢ € œirresponsibleÃ¢ €  and Ã¢ € œabsurd.Ã¢ €  He said the GOP will Ã¢ € œnot collect a ransom in return for not crashing the economy.Ã¢ € œWe are not a deadbeat nation,Ã¢ €  he said.At issue is the congressionally established debt limit, which the country is set to reach shortly. Without additional borrowing, the government will not be able to pay all of its bills, raising the prospect of a default on national debt payments or Washington being forced to stop issuing Social Security checks, pay to troops overseas and other legally required outlays, according to Obama. Either option would likely send shock waves through the fragile global economy.Raising the debt limit was mostly a matter of routine in Washington under presidents of both parties for decades. The opposition would make a big show of wringing its hands over the nationÃ¢ € ™s finances (as a senator in 2006, Obama himself called it Ã¢ € œa sign of leadership failure""), and the majority would find a way to pass it.Republicans broke sharply from that script in August 2011, when they demanded spending cuts equal to the amount that the limit would be raised. The ensuing standoff brought the nation to the brink of default and led to the first-ever downgrade of the countryÃ¢ € ™s credit ratingÃ¢ € ”but also to historic spending cuts, signed into law by Obama. Top Republican lawmakers have said publicly that this time they may be willing to partially shut down the government to secure more reductions.Ã¢ € œOur economy is growing and our businesses are creating new jobs, so we are poised for a good year if we make smart decisions and sound investmentsÃ¢ €  and so long as Washington politics Ã¢ € œdonÃ¢ € ™t get in the way,Ã¢ €  the president said."
PREG	Chance of miscarriage after 9wks?	I have officially made it to my 9th week of pregnancy, but still have to wait another 2 weeks to have my first ultrasound...this is my second pregnancy after a miscarriage 4 yrs ago and I have PCOS. Everything seems to be going fine, but I'm still very worried about miscarriage! Does anyone know what the chances are of having a miscarriage after reaching 9wks? Thanks :)

DISE	A fib	First time I had A fib it was in year 2000. I had been eating spicy food and red chillies raw with food. I was put on Comudain and since then I had about 3/4 episodes again. Every time either I had eaten heavy cheese and spices or simply spicy Indian food. My last episode still existing got triggered by a meal in a restraunt and the food was supposed to mild spicy and it came I think made of 100% red chillies only. I ate about 6 spoons and it damaged my stomach lining and the A fib started. I normally take Metapronol to lower the heart rate and not move around so much and the first day is the hardest. I sip Milk, eat plain yougurt, eat only steamed vegetables, rice and meals with only salt and no spices. Ice cream also helps to coat the stomach. Not sure if Comudain has made the stomach lining more sensitve over 8 years use.I have LVH - Left venrical hypertrophy with high BP which is controlled by Lopressor, Rythmol(Afib), Comudain, Vasotec(BP) and Lipitor.Does anyone know if Lipitor also irritates the stomach. I have been on it for 2 years and am thinking of dropping it. My cholestrol is at Border line. My problem is not much excercise due busy life schedule to earn a living most of the time and then resting to gather the energy.In my view the Vagal nerve connected from stomach to Heart is responsible for triggering Afib when either too spicy food is eaten or extreme acid reflux (GERD) and    triggered from a nerve from Oesphugus when too much food is gulped down at a fast rate. Both nerves are connected to heart.Doctors openly will not admit to it and My cardioligist does not either. We should write our experiances here so that the medical community does start to research this area and stop feeding comudian to us which was really discovered and made for Rat poision to bleed the rats to death in WWII time.I am no Doctor but my body tells me and I need to listen to that. My doc had swtiched me from Rythmol to Amiodrone which had huges side effects. My hands skin started to get dark in sun and while sleeping it would feel like there were bricks on my chest. Well I switched back and told me Doc I rather die than take Amiodrone. For me it worked, I had to change my eating habits. Since I travel 10 months a year it is hard and some time you just end up eating something that is not right. I usually stop and send the food back but you do not need much to damage the stomach specially if it is hot mexican food etc.I will be going on boiled and steamed Vegs and simple Monk food and try to get off some of these meds. Would appreciate comments on Lipitor.
DEMO	Bloody Discharge/White Bumps on Lips of Vagina, Itchyness? Help?	Hi Everyone!    I have never been to a Gyno even though I will be turning 18 in June.    I have been having repeated yeast infections throughout the years although this one (if it is a yeast infection) feels a bit different.I see a lot of these small white bumps on my inter lips leading into my vagina.    I'm concerned because, yes, I have noticed them there before, before and after yeast infections, I just want to know what their purpose is and whether I should be concerned about them.I just recently started noticing slight bloody discharge in my panties, too.    When I examine my vagina in a mirror I notice that my clit is red, looks like its cut, and discharging white chunks of, well, something, I don't know.My whole private area feels dry, when I touch it- it burns although I'm not having a burning sensation when I urinate.I am not a virgin.    My last boyfriend and I stole each others virginity. I'm ashamed to say, but every time we had sex, it was unprotected.    I haven't had sex for about 2-3 months now although I do masturbate often.I just need second opinions here, what could this be, just another yeast infection?
FAML	Out-of-Control 8 year old	I have an eight year old son who is the middle of three boys.    He excels at school and reads and does math above his grade level.

PREG	Update Re: IPS Genetic Screening And First Prenatal Visit	Hi all! I have been on here asking a few questions but mostly reading. I had some discussions with others regarding interest in the newer IPS genetic screening process.    I had my first prenatal appointment today and have decided to do the screening as there is some history of Down Syndrome in my family and Spina Bifida Oculatta in my b/f family also I will be 33 when I deliver.    My appt is April 24 and will update those interested about the procedure at that time.    I had my first ultrasound March 20 at 7 weeks 5 days heard a healthy heart beat and saw my little bean the screening will be a little extra peace of mind as I have had 2 m/c in the last 5 months but both were between the 7 and 8 week mark I am past this and am hoping this is a sign of good things to come.

FAML	10 yr old having accidents in pants	My ten year old son has had accidents (wetting and messing his pants) since he was potty trained.    These have occurred throughout his life.    I thought he would eventually grow out of it.    I have tried to talk to him about it, he always says he doesnt know why he did it or when he did it.    Could it be possible that he does this during an absence seizure?    When he was a baby he had some seizure like activity, when he would cry hard, he would tense up, grit his teeth, pass out and then wake up.    His pediatrican said he was just being stubborn, holding his breath, and I should not be concerned about it.    But now I am beginning to wonder if I should have been concerned.    I have no medical history as I was adopted, so we are figuring things out as we go.    Should I have him tested for seizure activity?

SOCL	Penis redness and irritation will not go away!	I am a 21 year old male. For the past two months I have been experiencing redness/inflammation on the head of my penis as well as the skin directly beneath the head. It is extremely sensitive all day and sore constantly, although worse at times. In the last year I have only had sexual contact with my long time partner and 2 other girls. When the symptoms began I was tested for gonorrhea, chlamydia, and bacterial infections, all clean. I was put on doxycycline for 10 days with no improvement. I then went and saw a urologist who put me on ciprofloxacin for 30 days, with no improvement. I went back to the same urologist and he prescribed mupirocin ointment for a week, no improvement. I went back to my original doctor who said it may be fungal and so told me to try lotrimin or monestat. I tried both with no improvement, then I was given 2 doses of diflucan which also did not help at all. I went and saw a dermatologist who told me it may be psoriasis and to try hydrocortisone ointment which has not helped either. I also have switched to hypoallergenic detergent and soap and all cotton underwear. I am beginning to seriously lose hope that anyone will be able to tell me what is wrong or how to fix it. The redness comes and goes, but it becomes very deep red and inflamed if I masturbate or have sex or even just have an erection. I have been told it is CERTAINLY not herpes by every single doctor due to it being constant for two months and there not being lesions but I am still fearful that this may be what it is. Can anyone tell me if this could possibly be herpes? Has anyone had similar problems or have any idea what the problem may be or how to fix it? Any insights or advice would be extremely appreciated, this whole thing is a nightmare and I am praying I find a solution soon!
TRMT	Reversal	Hi,I've had my ileostomy since October 2007 following extensive abdominal surgery for appendix cancer and psuedomyxoma peritonei. I saw my surgeon last week who said I can have the reversal, how soon is up to me - I'm leaving it until the end of the year as I've had so much time off work and want some time without feeling rough after surgery.I'd really prepared myself for her saying a reversal wasn't going to be on the cards, and to be honest I haven't really had any probems accepting 'the little 'un' either psychologically or practically. I have, however, read numerous tales of raging diarrohea and up to 20 BM's daily following reversal, and quite frankly I don't want that!I'm not entirely sure how much colon I've had removed. My surgeon is a bit (no a lot!) scary and I haven't asked, although I do know I had a lot of tumour around my rectum and it's usual to have at the least the ascending colon removed with appendix cancer. I've also had all non-essential abdominal organs and linings removed including about 6 inches of small intestines - my whole abdomen was described as looking as if it was spray painted white with tumour, all but 2 spots that are less than 2.5cm have been removed and they should be 'killed off' with intraperitoneal heated chemo during the surgery -    I feel almost back to 'normal' again and I want to get on with life again rather than having to worry about feeling tired/sore/embarrassed/ill/reminded/worried etc.I would like to know about other people's experiences of reversals, is 'it' like 'it' was before?Is it really just the odd few that have problems afterwards, and do they have an idea beforehand what it's going to be like?How much colon has to be left for good results?I've actually spent more time worrying about the consequences of getting rid of my ileostomy than I did getting one, which is mad!Lisa
DISE	Fluid filled arm for two weeks after hard hit, should i be concerned?	About two weeks ago, i got hit very hard on my forearm, towards the elbow. It was very tender and swollen for about a week, then it was hit again in the same spot. On the second week, my entire lower arm was filled with fluid. To the point where i could make indents in my arm that would last for several minutes.

TRMT	Same with me	I have been feeling like this since i was 12 years old and im 26 now. Doctors never could find out what was wrong. Been on numerous meds nothing helped. I tried smoking marajuana because i herd it helps with the nausea and IT DID. Been doing this for some time now. I dont smoke alot, just one hit or two about 30min to an hour before i eat and i feel normal and can eat without any problems. Not saying i think this is the best idea just nothing helped me and it got to a point where i completely stoped eating alltogether and started having more health issues. I got tired of feeling sick and never being able to eat I didnt feel normal and i lost hope and even got depressed and tried to commit suicide over it. Im so glad i found a solution but i still wish i could just figure out what is causing this and have it taken care of.-DrewThis discussion is related tofeel sick after eating.
GOAL	Favorite Exercise	"We know that exercise can help lift depression, energize us, keep our hearts healthy; and of course, it can help us lose weight, along with various other benefits.In trying to come up with interesting things to do in order to keep myself moving, I realize that there are a ton of various exercises, games and sports that can be done to keep us healthy, trim and in good spirits.I'm wondering what everyone's favorite exercise might be: walking, running; yoga, bicycling, going to the gym, videos/dvd's, etc.     You can have more than one.    Please let us know WHAT you prefer and WHY (how you    benefit most from it).I'll go first:        Some of you who have been around for a while, will know that my favorite is yoga.    Yoga centers on breathing, balance and stretching.    For me, it take immense concentration to achieve and hold the postures properly.    In the process of doing this, I have to push *everything* else out of my mind and concentrate ONLY on what I'm doing.    When I've finished a 30 minute session, I feel relaxed, my muscles feel stronger, longer and leaner, my breathing is much easier and I feel a very strong sense of accomplishment.My next favorite is walking.    Walking is one of the best exercises we can do.    It's proven to help with weight loss, muscle toning, and helps to make our heart strong, etc. When I go for a walk, I have the opportunity to look around at the sky, see the birds, flowers and other plants, butterflies and whatever else might be in my path.    I get what I might consider a ""spiritual"" feeling when I walk because I love being out where I can see all of God's creatures.    A nice walk, both relaxes and invigorates me.Okay, now it's your turn.    Hopefully, we can come up with a whole list of possibilities for those days when we just feel bored with our routine and want to try something different.................Ready, set .............GO"

SOCL	How to Relate to My Dad!	Since my mother passed away in May, I have been trying to get along better with my Dad, but he doesn't seem to want to do anything with me.    It seems like the only time I even see or talk with my Dad is when I need money for my son's speech therapy or afterschool care (which my parents offered to help me with).

He lives nearby so I don't see why he doesn't want to spend time with me or my son (his only grandson).    When I call him to see how he is, its a two minute call where all he says he is doing fine.    I don't understand why he doesn't want to talk or spend time with me?    I was thinking that maybe it was becasue I remind him too much of my mother, but I guess now that mom is gone, he has his freedom and is taking advantage of it.I don't know what else to do.

TRMT	Vitamins: It's Dose That Does It	"Vitamins: It's Dose That Does ItReprinted with permission from the International Schizophrenia Foundation, www.orthomed.orgEDITORÃ¢ € ™S NOTE: The following article focuses on the therapeutic effect of very high dose vitamins. Lower doses commonly found in dietary supplements are effective in meeting nutritional needs, but no therapeutic claims are made.(OMNS, February 2, 2009) There is a spin to most media reporting on vitamin research. The recent anti-vitamin media blitz, led by the Associated Press and USA Today, provides yet another demonstration. (Vitamins C and E don't prevent heart disease. The Associated Press, Nov. 9, 2008. Also: USA Today http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-11-09-supplements-study_N.htm ) With a paternalistic pat on the head, the media once again seeks to send you off to play with the reassurance that, well, vitamin therapy HAS been tested, and it just does not work.Nonsense. Thousands upon thousands of nutritional research studies provide evidence that vitamins do help prevent and treat serious diseases, including cancer and heart disease, when the nutrients are supplied in sufficiently high doses. High doses are required. Low doses fail. Says cardiologist Thomas Levy, M.D.: ""The three most important considerations in effective vitamin C therapy are dose, dose, and dose. If you don't take enough, you won't get the desired effects.""Effective doses are high doses, often hundreds of times more than the US Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) or Daily Reference Intake (DRI). Abram Hoffer, M.D., Ph.D., comments: ""Drs. Wilfrid Shute and Evan Shute recommended doses from 400 IU to 8,000 IU of vitamin E daily. The usual dose range was 800 to 1600 IU but they report that they had given 8,000 IU without seeing any toxicity."" The Shutes successfully treated over 35,000 patients with vitamin E.All the recent, much touted JAMA study does is confirm what we already know: low doses do not work. The doses given were 400 IU of vitamin E every OTHER day and 500 milligrams of vitamin C/day. Try that same study with 2,000 to 4,000 IU of vitamin E every other day (1,000 to 2,000 IU/day) and 15,000-30,000 mg/day of vitamin C and the difference would be unmistakable. We know this because investigators using vitamins E and C in high doses have consistently reported success.Low doses do not get clinical results. Any physician, nurse, or parent knows that a dose of antibiotics that is one tenth, or one-hundredth, of the known effective dose will not work. Indeed, it is a cornerstone of medical science that dose affects outcome. This premise is accepted with pharmaceutical drug therapy, but not with vitamin therapy. Most of the best-publicized vitamin E and C research has used inadequate, low doses, and this JAMA study falls right into line.High doses of vitamins are deliberately not used. Writes Robert F. Cathcart III, M.D.: ""I have been consulted by many researchers who proposed bold studies of the effects of massive doses of ascorbate (vitamin C). Every time the university center, the ethics committee, or the pharmacy committee deny permission for the use of massive doses of ascorbate and render the study almost useless. Seasoned researchers depending upon government grants do not even try to study adequate doses.""The most frequently proffered reason is the allegation that ""high doses of vitamins are not safe."" That is a myth. 25 years of national poison control statistics show that there is not even one death per year from vitamins. Check the research literature and see for yourself exactly who is being harmed by vitamins. Aside from the pharmaceutical industry, virtually nobody. Half of Americans take vitamin supplements every day. So where are the bodies?Decades of physicians' reports and controlled research studies support the use of large doses of vitamins. Yet to hear the media (and JAMA) tell it, vitamins are a Granny's folk remedy: a buggy- and barrel-stave technology that just doesn't make it.In the broadcast and print media, vitamin therapy is marginalized at best and derided at worst. Is this merely laughable, or is there method to it? One may start by asking, who does this serve? Could it possibly be the media's huge advertising-cash providers, the pharmaceutical industry? Pharmaceutical advertising money buys authors, ad space, influence, and complicity. Unfortunately, this is as true in the newspapers as it is in the medical journals.Let the news media begin by disclosing exactly where their advertising revenue comes from. It may explain where the spin on their articles comes from, too.Nutritional Medicine is Orthomolecular Medicine. Orthomolecular medicine uses safe, effective nutritional therapy to fight illness.

SOCL	Arrest in mom&#x27;s death, newborn&#x27;s kidnapping	"(CNN) -- A 30-year-old registered nurse faces capital murder charges in the death of a Houston-area woman and the abduction of the victim's newborn son, according to an arrest report.Verna McClain of Houston was arrested just before midnight Tuesday, according to the report. She is accused of shooting Kala Golden, 28, to death outside a pediatrician's office earlier in the day and kidnapping Golden's 3-day-old son, Keegan Schuchardt.The baby was found about six hours later, authorities said, and would be reunited with his father.According to the arrest report, Golden was leaving the Northwoods Pediatric Center in the Houston suburb of Spring, carrying Keegan.""The defendant confronted Mrs. Golden and shot her multiple times in the parking lot,"" the report said, then took the baby and left. CNN affiliate KTRK reported that the suspect struck Golden as she screamed and attempted to chase after the car. Golden, who was shot repeatedly, died at a hospital.McClain's vehicle was found at an apartment complex, according to the report. McClain returned to the apartment as the investigation was continuing and asked to speak to police, the report said.""She admitted to shooting Mrs. Golden and taking her baby,"" the arrest report said.

DISE	Scrotum is swollen, red, itchy...	About 2 months ago I had a really bad rash on my inner thighs that made it hard to even walk around. I went to my dermatologist and he prescribed Ketaconazole cream and another cortizone cream telling me it was a fungus. At first this was only on my thighs and not on my scrotum or penis. Those creams didn't really do much the first week but they did seem to irritate my scrotum. Two weeks later my thighs looked about the same and now my scrotum was very swollen, very itchy, and red. I went to a different dermatologist and he gave me Protopic cream and a prescrip for antibiotics (He also said to continue using the Ketaconazole as well). The first night I applied the Protopic to my scrotum the only thing I can say is it was the worst discomfort I have ever felt in my life... my scrotum was on fire! Ice was the only thing that would help it. I lost a few nights sleep because of it. I didn't continue using the Protopic but did continue using the Ketaconazole for about 2 weeks and everything finally got really dry and my skin on my thighs and on my scrotum (and a little on my penis as well) started to flake off. Then everything got back to normal and that's the way it stayed for about two months. Now about 2 weeks ago I ate a few mangos (never had them before) and had a reaction on my face. I had a rash around my eyes and my upper lip got blisters on it. I went to the derm. and he prescribed a dose of Prednisone. I took it for about 4 days and I was back to normal with my eyes still being a little itchy but the rash seems to be gone. Now two days after I stopped taking the prednisone my scrotum all of a sudden is all red, swollen, and itchy! The underside of my penis is inflamed as well. Nothing on my thighs at all. I lost another night of sleep last night because of the intense itchyness and now I don't know what to do. Is this a reaction to the prednisone? or the mangos? The Dr. gave me a 30ct supply of the prednisone but he told me to only take it for a few days... should I finish the prescription? Thanks for any help.

PREG	missed period!	I got the nuva ring from my doctor and was told to wait until the sunday after my next period to put it in. I had just gotten off my period when she gave it to me so i decided to wait until my next one. I started my last period on april 13...its now may 17 almost the 18th and still no period. The day i got the nuvaring i was curious to see if i could feel it during sex. I put it in to try it out but took it out right after since i wasnt supposed to use it yet. I took a test on the 11th and it was negative. I was wondering if that short time i had it in if it would effect my period.

FAML	The family bed	My 2 youngest children are 12 (boy) and 14(girl). I used to share custody with my ex,    but my kids would call me all the time needing BASIC COMFORTING that their father refused to provide. I would even read them books over the phone to help them fall to sleep. When they wouldcome to my house,my daughter would often sleep with me, needing the comfort and I figured she would outgrow it when she was ready, and she did,one year ago. Recently, my ex's physical and emotional abuse of my children got out of hand, and long story short, I now have primary custody. During these last 4 months of emotional upheaval, my 12 year old son wants to sleep with me all the time. It's a king sized bed, and there is certainly nothing innapropriate going on. I've asked him why he wants to always sleep in my bed, and he says because it feels so comfortable. ( His father punched him in the ribs repeatedly and told him he was nothing but a lazy fat slob.) I'm thinking he will outgrow this, as his sister did, but am I doing something wrong; am I hurting him somehow?
DEMO	pregnant or not?	HiI missed my period for over 3 month now. My period is never ontime n very irregular. In the last month i have experianced a lot of pregnancy symptoms. I had a very sharp pain on my left side. It lasted a whole night. I stared getting a lot of head aches, then i noticed my urine was bright yellow. I noticed there was a lot of white discharge down there! more than normal! After i started feeling naseous during the night..sometimes in the morning too. My lower back is killing me. I gained a lot of weight within the last month too. My eting habit changed a lot. I feel like im hungry again after like an hour. Havent really been eating much throughout the day so i thought it was because of that. My aereola is a bit darker and my boobs are a lot bigger. Not really getting much pain in them but certain things I do i notice they are a little sore. I took 2 pregnancy tests but they were all negative. I have an dr apt next week. I was wondering if it could be anything else besides pregnancy? I dont think im stressed because im really happy with everythin in my life right now and how things are goin for me. Am I just pregnant or could it be something else?

SOCL	Holder sues to get AIDS infected prisoners desegragated from healthy	"By: J. Christian AdamsOpEd ContributorAugust 9, 2010Two unpleasant topics of conversation most of us avoid are the epidemic of HIV/AIDS among prison inmates and a variety of sometimes violent events resulting in transmission of the disease. Some states long ago implemented policies to protect the uninfected part of the prison population while providing exceptional medical treatment and counseling to the infected population.In South Carolina, it has worked so well since 1998 that there has only been a single transmission of HIV/AIDS to a noninfected prisoner. All that may change, however, thanks to a threat from Eric Holder's Justice Department.South Carolina received a letter from the now-infamous Civil Rights Division that the policy of keeping infected inmates at a designated facility, instead of scattered across the state in the general prison population, may unfairly stigmatize infected prisoners. To the Obama political appointees in the Civil Rights Division, this constitutes discrimination under the Americans With Disabilities Act.The Justice Department objects to separate living facilities and specialized medical treatment for the HIV/AIDS prison population. Naturally, DOJ has threatened a lawsuit.Apparently the Justice Department doesn't have the will or resources to follow through in cases against New Black Panther Party thugs brandishing weapons at polling places, but has no difficulty shaking down a state with an effective and humane policy toward prisoners.""These folks are shameless,"" says John Ozmint, the no-nonsense director of the South Carolina prison system, referring to the Civil Rights Division at DOJ. He told me that every single new prisoner is tested for AIDS upon incarceration.Ozmint says half of those testing positive never knew they were infected. The testing policy saves lives because treatment starts immediately, at state expense.Those testing positive receive treatment at the Broad River Road correctional facility near Columbia. They also receive extensive counseling there. But they are not part of the general prison population.South Carolina doesn't have to do this. For starters, the state doesn't have to test prisoners. It could simply toss infected inmates unwittingly into the general prison population.These inmates would be scattered across 28 facilities, all without the specialized care available at the Broad River facility. All of the extra counseling and treatment is also optional, but provided by the state at significant expense.South Carolina spends more than $2 million a year helping infected inmates in the very program the DOJ is challenging. ""We couldn't ever hire specialists at all of the facilities spread across the state like we can in the single Columbia facility,"" Ozmint told me.The DOJ is in a lose-lose situation. Even if DOJ wins a lawsuit, sources tell me South Carolina is simply going to cancel all of the special testing, treatment and counseling, thereby saving the state $2 million a year.Instead, the state will dump infected prisoners into the general population, and nobody will know they have AIDS. Worse, prisoners who come to prison with HIV/AIDS will never know they have the disease and their lives will be shortened because the testing program will end.Special counseling would end, too. Of course, if DOJ loses a lawsuit, which seems likely, they lose.""Our policy promotes health and safety. Testing all inmates and treating HIV/AIDS is expensive and many states do not test,"" Ozmint says. They have identified which ""inmates can impose a death sentence by biting, stabbing or merely inflicting a flesh wound with a contaminated weapon and we have eliminated the spread of HIV/AIDS to other inmates or to staff.""Justice raises three primary objections to this effective and humane approach. First, it prevents infected prisoners ""from participating in activities and jobs of their choosing."" Leave it to bureaucrats in Washington to concoct the grievance that prisoners have choices when it comes to activities in the first place.Second, DOJ claims the South Carolina program is unconstitutional, something the courts have repeatedly rejected. Once again we see the rule of law falling by the wayside when it comes to decisions of this Civil Rights Division. This is the same Civil Rights Division that was sanctioned more than $4 million during the Clinton administration for bringing cases as frivolous as the one against South Carolina prisons.Third, with all the pragmatism of a sociology lecture at Harvard, DOJ argues that the separation of the HIV/AIDS prisoners ""stigmatizes"" the prisoners. Ozmint responds, ""Prison is a voluntary activity; breaking the law, earning a criminal record, and wearing 'state issue,' all stigmatize. Since one purpose of prison is punishment, this stigmatization is somewhat intentional."" How refreshing.Ozmint's comments reveal the accelerating divide between highly paid bureaucrats in Washington and people in the rest of the country. Having worked in the Civil Rights Division, I cannot emphasize strongly enough how perfectly correct and completely justified DOJ bureaucrats consider policies like the threat to South Carolina to be. And having lived and worked in the private sector and in parts of America far from the Beltway, I also cannot overstate just how insane such policies sound to most Americans.It isn't just the South Carolina prisons in the crosshairs of the Civil Rights Division. It is mortgage lenders and insurance companies. It is movie theaters and flat-broke counties that don't print ballots in foreign languages.It's also Amazon.com, which tried to sell a talking Kindle reader, but Justice said it couldn't because the button to make the Kindle talk didn't have Braille. Never mind that books neither talk nor have Braille buttons telling them to talk.The business community would be wise to wake up and recognize the immense power the Civil Rights Division exerts over the private sector. Groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce should devote resources to understanding and moderating the extremist tendencies of the current Civil Rights Division. Even returning to Clinton-era policies would be an improvement.Keep in mind that the Clinton Justice Department refused to attack the South Carolina prison plan even though it was pressed to do so. There is now a different species of Democrat in power in Washington.Even South Carolina Democrats have disclaimed their party brethren in Washington over the DOJ threat. This is the last thing incumbent Democrat John Spratt needs in his contest against Mick Mulvaney in the rural 5th Congressional District -- more proof the administration in Washington has gone bonkers.""This is about whether you want more AIDS or less AIDS"" in the prisons, Ozmint said. All indications are that the South Carolina Department of Corrections isn't going to surrender an inch to the DOJ.Officials promise to do whatever it takes to defeat a lawsuit. No case brought by the Civil Rights Division is bulletproof. Many defendants incorrectly think they can never defeat the department in litigation, so they capitulate and settle.As South Carolina may soon demonstrate to the rest of the nation, it pays to fight back.J.

TRMT	Abdominal Hysterectomy	I had a lumpectomy 2 years ago and have been on Tamoxifen for 2 years.    After I started taking Tamoxifen (age 52) my periods stopped for about 6 months and then started again about once every 3 or 4 months with the last one being quite heavy.    I am 54 years old and I was still pretty regular before the Tamoxifen.    My gynecologist is recommending that I get a radical (abdominal) hysterectomy since I am still having periods.    I had a D&C last year and had a benign polyp removed.    Just had a trans-vaginal ultrasound 2 weeks ago and everything was fine. My gynecologist thinks that I should not be having any periods at all at my age and because of the chance of uterine cancer with the tamoxifen he feels that a radical hysterectomy is the way to go.    Just looking to hear other opinions.

PREG	Tubal?  Vasectomy??  IUD??? HELP! :o)	"So, I am currently over 37 weeks pregnant.    DH and I had talked and decided months ago that a vasectomy was probably our best option since we are not planning to have any more children.    The problem is, that is as far as it went so far, talk lol.    We have discussed it several times since then and I even suggested he do it soon b/c I know it isn't an immediate solution.     I read on one of the forums here that it can take up to a year for vasectomy to take full effect (and don't even make me think about the lady that told me her neighbor's DH had one, and she got pg, then she had a TUBAL and got pg again!!    I nkow that is very rare but OMG, the thought terrifies me! lol)    From what I understand is you have to keep going back to the urologist with a    ""sample"" so they can check if there are any sperm left and it is not considered ""safe"" until the sample is cleared.    I told DH that and he didn't seem to have any problem with it and was still on board.    Even agreed it should be done soon (this was months ago) since I obviously can't get pg WHILE pg and for the weeks after the birth when we have to abstain.    Well...??    The baby is due any day now and still no appointment, and he has not brought up the subject again.    I don't want to push him to do something he really doesn't want to do, so I am not going to badger him on the issue, he obviously has some hesitation or it would be done.    But I need SOME form of birth control soon.    I had to get off the pill b/c I was getting migraines all the time and was lethargic, moody, and hated the fact that weight would not come off no matter what I did.    I am thinking of getting an IUD.    The copper one though b/c as I stated I do not do well with hormones.    Anyone have experiences, good or bad, to share about this form of BC?Just wanted to ask anyone's experiences with any of these methods: vasectomy, copper IUD or tubal.    I am scared of the tubal b/c of pain, scarring, other possible complications, hormones going out-of-whack, and I've read that it can also cause weight gain.    Any help, advice, or personal experiences would help, thanks!"

PREG	Ideas for when I am away from my little ones	I am going in for brain surgery soon. One of the things that devastates me is the thought of being away from my little ones (1 1/2 and 3 1/2) for so long. With no complications, I will be in the hospital for 3-5 days. I suspect I will not want them to visit me there, as I will look pretty bad. Of course, I'll still look gross when I get home, but we will deal with that when that time comes. I got Mommy/Daughter portraits done to remind them of what I will look like again once I am healed.I have only been away from them for 1 night. I need the creative mommas here to help me come up with ideas to help me and them!So far, I have bought them a small present for every day I am gone. It is something that can help entertain them for that day (paint sets, dress up, toys, etc.)I used my webcam to record our nightly prayers together. I am also using my webcam to record me reading stories with them. I will leave the videos for their caregivers to watch with them if they get upset or sad. If they are getting through fine, then there's no need to remind them I'm not there.Any other thoughts or ideas? I know someone who used a paper chain with links to be removed for each day the parent was gone, but I don't know how long I will be gone.I know people leave their kids all the time. I just haven't and this is not the best way to start. There are different people coming and going to watch them, and of course everyone I trust to care for my kids is also stressed out about my surgery. I know they will be fine, and I'm probably just transferring my anxieties to this because it's easier to worry about this than think about all the risks of surgery. But i have to plan, I have to do something!!

He came to school and was completely unmanageable by two different teachers.    He was brought to me and I struggled terribly with him.    He was fine with me and would do acceptable work with me; however, as soon as any children came into the class he could not and would not work.    His behavior crashed everytime and he was eventually taken out of the class.    Eventually I convinced Mom to take him to the Dr with my data (observations) and they put him on an ADHD medicine.    Three weeks passed and his behavior was greatly improved.    He never had to be removed from the class.    However, he still will not do any work.    He not only won't do work he's deliberately giving wrong answers to obvious questions he knows the answers to.    Sarcastic responses.    If I removed all the students from the class he will begin working without a hitch and do excellent work.    If adults come into the room he will work fine regardless of how many, but if they are kids - he shuts down immediately.    What on earth is happening that a child can't function around othe kids only adults.    He's failing school because he does no work.    He's very sad all the time.    Bright child, very smart.    Loves knowing things functions well with adults.    Flips switch and crashes when similar age students are with him.    Can't funtion around his peers.    Any help would be appreciated
DISE	Lower abdomen pain when I walk	I have this pain that will crop up in my lower left abdomen region.    However the pain only occurs like after a strenous walk with my dog or pushing a full shopping cart around the store.    If I am laying down, or sitting and such no pain.    Sometimes the pain, or really ache feels like it also goes around to my lower back.    It is kinda like the pain/ache I get when I have kidney stones, but like I said only hurts when I do certain things, otherwise I have no discomfort or ache at all.

PREG	Does Clomid work on the first cycle or does it usually take awhile?	I got pregnant with my first child while I was on birth control and got pregnant very easily with my second pregnancy, which ended with a miscarriage. My husband and I have been trying to get pregnant again for the last 10 months and have had no luck. I went into the doc and found out that I was not ovulating. My doc put me on clomid and 50mg days 3-7. I finished it last Friday and am wondering how long it will take to work. I guess what I really want to hear is your success stories or any advice on what worked for you! Thanks for the input!

DISE	weird sensation in face along with other symptoms	"Hello, I am a 22 year old male who was healthy until last October.    My chief complaints are major fatigue, anxiety, depression, daily headaches, night sweats, arthritis like pain in body, heart palpitations and mainly an odd facial sensation.I have had multiple blood test ran along with a 3 chest CT's, 1 Abdomen CT (Came out I had appendicitis had the surgery still havent got better), multiple EKGs, an echocardiogram and a sinus CT.    All have came back normal.    I am here about the facial sensation.    It is odd in that it is not really a horrible pressure but more a feeling of tightening or pinching in a direct spot.    It seems to run in a line from my hairline in my forehead to the tip of my nose and also between my eyebrows.    It doesnt really hurt all that much but it is very annoying. Its like a centralized tightening sensation.    I can get it all over my face but it stays mostly confined between the brows and bridge of my nose and sometimes I get a tightening sensation above my ears and temples.The only pain I get is a slight pressure behind the right eye but it comes and goes.    I have had brain MRI and CT scans in the past an all was fine, but I think im going to beg for another one this coming week at my doctors appointment.    I have been seeing doctors for 6 months now and no one seems to know why these things are happening to me.    Also, I do not have a recent MRI but my last neurologist gave a full inspection of my body (strength, feeling, eye movement) and I have a recent eye check up which showed no signs of internal pressure.Anyone have any ideas?All these symptoms started after a 3 month work trip (Utah, Nevada, Kansas, Buffalo NY, New York NY) and what was suppose to be a relaxing trip out to Vegas.    I first got sick on the way back from Vegas had a horrible case of diarrhea followed about an hour later by general malaise, dizziness and sore muscles. I remember my girl friend asking me ""what was wrong, do you have a headache?""    I just told her I was sore all over.Please any ideas to discuss with the doctor on tuesday would be nice my family and girl friend just want their old son and boyfriend back an I want to be feeling good to!    Before this I was an athlete, skier, hockey player, weight lifter and I ran 7 miles almost daily.    It has now become a chore just to go to work.Please help!I have been tested for HIV, West Nile and Lyme which all came back negative.    I had a positive tuberculous skin test but clear X ray and with no fever dr's dont think thats whats making me tired.    Also had very high epstein barr numbers but this gets mixed reviews from the doctors.Currently waiting on second set of epstein barr numbers and blood test for different types of fungus's in the areas I visited.    I believe I'm going to ask for another Lyme disease test, MRI and even maybe something to test for malnutrition (thinking maybe B vitamins or magnesium deficiency ?    I have also not taken a brown looking bowel movement since this began.All help is much appreciated!"
PREG	is my due date wrong	Hi everyone.....I have a question about my pregnancy and was hoping for some insight. my LMP was    4/16/2010by that my est. due date is 1/21/2011    ~ I went to the dr on June 10th and they did a ultra sound.....they couldn't see anything so they did the internal wand one. We found 2 sacs and a heart    beat.....the Dr said we all start out as 2 sacs and ask me if I was sure about my last LMP........I keep very good track of them. Now I am so worried that something is wrong but I DON'T    go back until July 8th for another sono. I guess my question is am I just not as far along as I thought or is something my right with the baby. The waiting is just so hard and I am a worrier so that doesn't help. Thanks for listening

PREG	Aches & Pains Part II	"I'm not stranger to ovarian cysts. BIG ovarian cysts. The other night when I went to the ER and had an u/s done, they discovered ovarian cysts on both ovaries, the gall bladder looked normal, and most importantly....the gestational and yolk sacs were in the uterus not in the the tubes. Since I had that u/s, the pain has worsened and lowered. It is in the area of my ovaries and much lower into the pelvic area. This pain now feels like I've been sucker punched 100 times in that area. Very tender. It feels different (worse) than the pain I've felt with cysts in the past.My OB had my betas drawn yesterday as a follow up to my ER visit, but I didn't see him to mention the pains. I'm wondering if something worse is going on (though I'm not sure what it would be) or if I'm just feeling particularly ouchy from the vaginal u/s ""poking"" around in there. Or maybe this is normal for a 2nd pregnancy fresh after surgery. Not sure. Any insight?I feel like one of those psycho posters that posts the same thing 10 times just to get an answer. Really, I'm not. lol"
FAML	4 Year Old Refuses pants/touches herself	"I nanny for a family with three kids.    9,7, and 4.    The four year old is a girl and has just this week started acting strange.    On Monday she went potty and was in there forever.    She was being really private about it all and was shutting me out completely.    She flushed but for at least 20 minutes, if not more, she kept wiping and wiping.    Her mother told me this was not too strange as she has done this before but after she finished she refused to put underwear on.    She wouldn't tell me why and she also refused pants.    She went around with just a shirt on the rest of the day.The next day I went to the house in the morning and for almost 2 hours the mom fought with her about having to wear underwear.    She cried and cried, ""I don't want to wear underwear!""    She also will not wear pants.    Since Tuesday she understands she must wear underwear, but she WILL NOT wear pants.    Her mom and I have to dress her in only dresses, which is getting tricky with the weather getting colder and colder.I have noticed in the past week or so that she also always has her hand in her panties and wants a lot more private time.    She has started wanting to be in her room alone and wants me to go outside so she can stay alone inside.    Yesterday, I went outside to play with her siblings and when I came back in to check on her, she had her hand in her panties again.She has also started to freak out when I tell her that we need to go somewhere (school, to get her siblings, dance, etc).    Today when I put her in her carseat she freaked out when I tried to buckle it saying, ""I don't want it buckled!""    I told her I had to and convinced her to do so.    Right when I placed her in the carseat, she put her hand in her panties.    I'm worried it's a new habit or some kind of coping mechanism for anxiety she is having.    And I wonder if the reason she didn't want the seat buckled was due to not being able to put her hand in her panties.I am at such a loss for what to do, as is everyone close to her.    I want so badly to understand so I can help her, but I am helpless."

SOCL	Muslim opponent of mosque reports threat	Sunday, August 22, 2010News CanadaMuslim opponent of mosque reports threatBy Brian Lilley, Parliamentary BureauOTTAWA - She spoke out against the Ground Zero mosque, now a Canadian Muslimwoman says she is being threatened. Raheel Raza, a founding member of the Muslim Canadian Congress, calls the idea of a mosque within 300 metres of Ground Zero Ã¢ € œa deliberate provocation.Ã¢ € Last week Raza joined Maureen Basnicki a Canadian widow of 9-11 in attending a meeting about the mosque in New York City.Ã¢ € œThey were very arrogant. They didnÃ¢ € ™t answer questions,Ã¢ €  Raza told QMI Agency.The meeting was hosted by Daisy Khan, the wife of the Imam promoting the mosque and Sharif El Gamal, the man whose property firm owns the land the mosque is to be built on.Raza says she asked questions about who was financing the building, estimated to cost $100 million, and whether any of the money would come from countries other than the United States. There has been much speculation that the mosque is being funded through Saudi Arabian sources but at the Manhattan meeting Raza said there were no answers.On Monday, back in Toronto, Raza says she received a call on her cellphone from a man who identified as Sharif El Gamal. Ã¢ € œHis tone was intimidating,Ã¢ €  said Raza. Ã¢ € œHe accused me of 'jumping intoÃ¢ € ™ the meeting he called and then said 'May Allah protect you.Ã¢ € ™ I was shocked and hung up.Ã¢ € Raza says she took the phone call as a clear threat against her.Ã¢ € œWhy would I need AllahÃ¢ € ™s protection?Ã¢ €  asked Raza.Raza says El Gamal's tone was threatening and she took the phone call as a clear threat against her, and not as it is sometimes used, as a casual phrase meaning goodbye. Contacted at his New York office El Gamal initially didnÃ¢ € ™t have much to say. Ã¢ € œIÃ¢ € ™m confused by your phone call,Ã¢ €  he said before hanging up.Contacted a second time El Gamal said Ã¢ € œThere was no phone call made by anybodyÃ¢ €  before again hanging up the phone to abruptly end the call.Raza insists there was a call, Ã¢ € œI saved the number on my cell.Ã¢ €  The number on RazaÃ¢ € ™s cellphone matches that of El GamalÃ¢ € ™s Soho Properties offices in New York.The proposal to build a mosque so close to Ground Zero has become a hot political topic in the United States.Mauren Basnicki, who lost her husband Ken in the attacks on the World Trade Center, told QMI Agency she originally had an open mind about the mosque being built so close to the site of the 9-11 attacks, now she is against it.Ã¢ € œWe all believe in religious tolerance. I donÃ¢ € ™t think for one minute that this is about religious tolerance,Ã¢ €  said Basnicki.Speaking with QMI Agency from her home in Collingwood, Ont., Basnicki says many might be afraid to speak out for fear of being branded as bigoted but to her the location is just insensitive and sheÃ¢ € ™d like to see it move.

DEMO	what's wrong with me?	I've been working a lot, and honestly, I've been eating even more poorly than I usually do, and getting very little sleep. Monday night I felt like I was coming down with a cold. Tuesday morning I had really bad diarrhea all day, was nauseated beyond belief, and really weak and tired. I got some pepto bismol. Yesterday i felt a bit better, the diarrhea seemed to be gone, and I ate last night before bed, which was probably a bad idea. Now this morning, the diarrhea is back, and on top of it, acid reflex which i keep burping, and can taste last nights dinner and then feeling like it's gonna come back up. More than once the nausea has resurfaced, and I've had to stay close to the bathroom. Others have asked me about possible pregnancy, which... well, I haven't had a real period since December 2008. and even the slight periods I have had, haven't surfaced since March.any ideas? I can't go to the doctors right now due to some mix up with my medical insurance.

FAML	how do i determine if my 13 yr. old son has ADHD or behavior and anger problems?	"My son was    diagnosed with ADHD 3 mos. ago. He is 13 almost 14 Yrs. old, his Father and I divorced 6 yrs. ago and we have joint custody of him and our other 9 yr. old son. For 2 yrs. now my 13 yr. does not ever bring books home from school and says he does his homework at school. I have a problem with this because he had to go to summer school last year, and get phone calls from teachers almost every day because he cusses them and wont leave other students alone and disrupts almost every class. Well, my wake-up call was in Nov. of 08', one of his teachers calls to tell me that he was sitting on another students desk and after several times of telling him to get off of the desk he got up and the top of the desk broke, a screw popped out and hit the teacher in the eye. Well, we take him to the Dr. and he sends me to a Psychiatrist. They ran some tests on him at the Hospital and turned out he does have ADHD. The Dr. prescribed hi,m Abilify 2.5mgs. daily. Also Melatonin at night for good rest, the 1st night on the Melatonin he wet the bed. I called the Doc back that day and she told me to take him off of the Melatonin. Still bedwetting occasionally. On April 1 2009 he got very angry because he had to go to the Dr. again. and refused to get into my car when I picked him up at his Dad""s, he asked his Grandpa(Step) where the key to his Dad""s gun cabinet is that he wanted to shoot me or worse himself. I called the police because I can't control him and neither could his Step-Grandpa.The Police made him get in my car and go to the Dr. and told us to make sure that all the guns are removed from the Dad""s home. The Pediatrician took him off of the Abilify and sent us back to Therapy, well my son refuses to go there again also. On my week with the boys on 4/28/09 my son was constantly hitting on his little brother so I tried to disapline him by putting him in his room and that did not work, he told me several times he hates me and wishes I would die! He""s also telling his little brother to tell me the same thing. I took him to a new Psychiatrist yesterday and he says he thinks that he does not have ADHD so I am very confused. It is not normal to tell your own mother you hate her let alone, tell her to die. This has been going on for a year now, cursing me all the time, staying out all the time as late as he wants. I feel like I am a failure as a mother and that it is my fault but I know this is another wake-up call for me and I don""t what to do and feel like there is nowhere else to turn. The Father of my son refuses to go to any Doctors with us and I need some advise very, very desperately! Keep in mind this Psychiatrists insist that I give up my every other week with him, keep him away from his little brother and life should be better for my son if he stays with his dad!!!! Not normal to me at all because he is trying to sound like a Lawyer instead of a Psychiatrist which happens to be a friend of the Dads Family. Please help!!!    Thank You, very confused!This discussion is related toAggressive Behavior."

When you unzip it,it opens up to reveal 3 sections with pockets to put supplies.    It also has a zippered pocket and a regular pocket on the outside. Also, on the outside, there is a large hook on one end and a handle on the other.    I can't believe they don't still make something comparable to this for ostomates who travel, etc.    So far, I've had no luck finding it or something comparable.    Hope someone out there can help."

SOCL	I can help, over time.	"I have read with much interest and concern regarding the list's interest in how liver disease progresses and how it results.Last April (2007), I took some blood tests. I have Hep C (since 1994 or before), and I am an alcoholic. My liver, in April, was diagnosed as ""imminent failure"".I work out everyday, as in the past, for about an hour. I am extremely healthy-looking on the outside.As this list is so interested in how liver disease progresses, I would be glad to contribute descriptions of my gradual degradation.To the best of my knowledge, there is only one treatment for Hep C. That is ""interferon"". It is a 50% chance of success, with ""chemotherapy-like"" implications. In 1994, I declined the treatment. In that year, I had a liver biopsy. While I don't remember what the results showed, I do remember that the doctor told me to do a biopsy every year. I did not.I live a normal life with my wife who is many years younger than myself. She likes going out a lot. I like that too.In April 2007, I took a blood test that caused me to quit drinking/smoking for about 4 months. But, I returned to both.Over the past year or so, I've noticed that my urine gets very cloudy. I have no pain, no other symptoms of liver failure. However, cloudy urine is a symptom of liver failure, so I assume my liver situation is worsening. The cloudiness used to take a couple hours to be evident, now, it takes but an hour.While I've not returned for any additional tests, I believe I am in liver failure.I will make an effort to post to the list how I progress with this, if there is interest. I don't plan to change anything in my lifestyle, I am not a ""transplant"" kind of guy, so don't expect to ""heal"".If the list members are interested in reading how I progress, please post your expressions of interest to the list. I will respect what responses are received.If any listmember has questions, I will try to answer them."

FAML	4yr  old son is aggressive	"Im 24, single mom of two and live with my parents.My son is 4 and started school this year in pre-k. I was hoping that interacting with others would calm him down and open him up, but i was wrong.His history. He was born at 41 weeks, had no problems except for the webing under his tongue need to be cut so he could feed properly. He was colic bad up until 4 months, after that he developed cronic(chronic)constipation which went undiegnosed till age 2 where he was tested, xrayed, seen a specialist and had more things done to him a grown man would run from. He is an extreamly picky eater which makes it very hard to make him eat regular food. He is literally 28 lbs at 4 yrs old and was 20 lbs for 2 years. His sister is 5 (10 1/2 months apart) and they have the usual fights like all siblings do.Okay more for mental issues: his father and me are not together due to fights. At 2 years old I remember his father screaming at him one day because he came home very stressed and i was busy with cooking so i couldnt really tend to the kids(they were fussy and crying).( wonderful military for you) soon after i left my husband because of abuse.Once my kids and I moved I noticed he was having nightmares and crying in his sleep, it took awhile for him to get over those. He started to act out at 3 yrs old. Screaming, crying, throwing himself on the ground, hitting his head on things, hitting himself and just being dificult.He started being agressive to his sister who is terrified of him when he gets angry. He will throw toys at her, hit, kick and even bite her. At school I get the same talk. He hits other kids and hits his teacher, Screams, throws his food and will not calm down. He has these fits several times in a 5 hour period.I've tried talks with him, being calm, time out, taking away toys and it just doesnt work. He is so short tempered, anything will set him off, even positive praise when he is good. very quiet, shy, loving.I think all this might be tied to the over whelming pain he delt with due to his dad doing what he did and us fighting when he was younger, him being colic, and then the cronic(chronic)constipation( he wont go #2 for a week to 2 wks) all in a very short time period. Can agression be passed down geneticly? His father is very agressive and dificult as well, ive noticed even his family has ""issues"" like that.Im truely lost, ive asked the doctor about what can be done and she is clueless. Ive asked the school and they are pointless and push us aside( love the public school for that).I find myself crying almost every morning because of this, im scared im gonna have the next kid who is thrown in jail for his temper, or be thrown out of school.    Im sorry if this is all jumbled, im still upset over hearing his teachers tell me he was hitting others again. i know there was something else i was wanting to say but with stress im a bit forgetful right now."

DISE	Test for a Stroke?	I've been told there is a test to see if 911 should be called for someone suspected of havine a stroke.    The test consists of three actions to ask the suspected stroke victim to perform.    The three questions are;1) Ask the person to smile.2) Ask the person to raise both arms.3) Ask the person to speak a simple sentence.Supposedly, if the person can't do one or more of these things, there's a chance he's having a stroke.    Is this true?    Is there any case in which it's not true?Thanks in advance!John

GOAL	suitable IOL for 36 year old high myope	I'm really hoping someone can advise me..the main problem is I am British but live in France and my French isn't up to quizzing Dr's on benefits of various IOL's and i will need one soon - i don't want to make amassive mistake or miss out because i am not aware of all options . I'm female and just 36 years old.I have small posterior subcapsular cataracts and myopia of -9 left eye, -10 right eye. I have moderate to terrible floaters in right eye (have reached tipping point where vitrectomy might be only option) - very mild floaters in left eye which, if they didn't worsen, i could quite happily live with forever and no way would i risk a vitrectomy for. Apparently my retina is 'amazingly good' for a high myope (not sure if that's important - but hey, at least its a some good news!).I would like an IOl in my right eye in the next few months - if i am honest, i must say i have a tiny secret hope it will positively affect floaters or the improvement in vision may detract from them . I feel left eye might be able to wait a couple of years or even more. Is an accomodative lens out of the question for a patient of -10 bearing in mind i am in Europe? I think by the time the left eye needs doing accomodative lenses for high myopes will be available and i feel that if i have amono in one eye and an accomodative lens in the other i will feel unbalanced and perhaps suffer eye strain or headaches.In hope!

DEMO	Could I really have herpes??	I got involved with a new partner almost a month ago. Last week I got sick with a flu, and once the flew blew over I had a bump inside of my labia major. I went to the doctor, he said it wasn't herpes, but I did have a uti and bv. However, the rash got worse and I had to go back. The bumps would form rings/craters and then turn into what looks definitely like a cold sore, raised edges and white in the middle. Now they look like they're healing, I can't tell, but the edges are sinking down and they're still white. They don't hurt or burn, only a bit if I brush up against them or pee. I had a tiny bit of itching at night when another one appeared very close to the inside of my vagina. I also have very, very swollen lymph nodes in my groin area, I've never felt them that swollen before. On my next doctors visit, one doctor told me it really didnt look like herpes, another says that it is. There were swabs taken and I can't find out for sure until another week. For now, I'd like to hear if anyone else has experienced it or is familiar with it, what else it could be? I've looked at pictures of herpes, it doesn't hurt, it doesn't itch, and they are clear enough that I can easily count how many of the sores I have. In the case that it is herpes, I did notify my partner about what is going on, we're both extremely scared. Any advice is appreciated.
GOAL	Large lump gums/inner cheek	Hello Dr. Tsang,My question is about my top molar second to the back. It has given me problems for quite some time and I think a filling may have fallen out.    12 days ago I was out shooting a rifle which put some pressure on my right cheek ,however I felt no obvious pain or injury at the time. That night I noticed slight swelling on the right side of my face. The next day it was pretty swollen, and I could feel a very large,hard bump when I ran my finger along my upper gums/inner cheek. The next day I went to the dentist who put me on Augmentin 875g bid ,and said my xray showed an abcess(abscess)above the bad tooth. By the way, I never had any pain whatsoever, at all. 1 week later I returned to his office for a debridement of the abcess(abscess).    He said the antibiotics were doing the job and no pus came out at all. He put a temp filling over the tooth and I will return in one month for a root canal and crown.    However today, 2 days later, my face is extremely swollen and bruised and the hard lump is still on my upper gums ,not smaller at all. My question is why hasn't the lump reduced in size after debridement? Could it have been a huge hematoma and not an abcess(abscess), due to the pressure of the rifle on my cheek? My face is a little sore from being swollen, but no tooth pain all all, never was. I fear the lump may have been there a long time, and I am wondering if cancer is an issue? The lump looked clear on the xray but you could see the outline of it.    He is a good dentist , and I assume if their was any question he would not let it wait. Right?

DISE	scared of hysterectomy for Borderline ovarian cancer	HiI was diagnosed with borderline ovarian cancer---it is not a mucinous or serous, It is a    endometriod(sorry spelling)cell after removal of my Left ovary.    It was only 1 cm and missed by 2 pathologist but then diagnosised by a university hospital, I went as saw a gyn/onc who sent it to John hopkins that actually almost missed it, but confirmed the diagnosis.    You get alot of mixed imformation about this diagnosis and part of me feels that having a hysterectomy is going over board, but there is no studies out there about just observing it and how many get it back if they don't have the hysterectomy.I have some people say I wouldn't have a hysterectomy---you will never be the same again---sex, orgasm, memory problems, mood swings.I know I am fortuanate that this is not actual invasive ovarian cancer---and I feel blessed that I don't have that.    I actually went on another web site for ovarian cancer and the women there actually were telling me I was self center and should be thankful that I am alive.    Please don't get me wrong I am thankful and I think God has bless me, but I am so afraid of surgical menopause what it will do to me---I have 3 kids under 5 years of age!I guess I just want to hear that just like childbirth that things are not quite physically but still things work. Does that make sense?Thanx for listen

GOAL	Left eye bigger than right eye after injury	Hi3-4 months ago I was hit in the eye by a racquet ball when I did not wear the glasses that day. Diagnosed with Abrasion, Micro hyphema and Berlyn Edema initially and everything was resolved and I had no vision loss. After complete checkup after 1 month the Dr's at Will's eye confirmed I am good but the week later I noticed my injured eye is bigger than the other eye. Recently 3+ months after injury I consulted a Retina spl and I was told that I have a PVD ( Post Vitreous Detachment)    and Chorio-retina scar but diagnosed that I have no complications related to it and should visit next yr. When asked about the bigger eye, he could not find anything and finally they took my blood sample and negative to any thyroid etc. He suggested to monitor my eye and told it may be normal after a while..but I still curious to find out what may have caused it if no bone fracture or muscle tear etc. Would appreciate if someone can answer this

FAML	ODD	My 4 year old son was recently diagnosed with ODD back in August. They prescribed him with a low dose of Rilalin. I only give it to him once a day. He is in preschool and for a while he was doing good I thought the medication was working, now    I don' t think it is working to well. do you think that he should have his dosage increased or the frequency the medicine is being administered. I have also worried that the medication might be making his behaivor worse. You want the best for your kids and I feel so bad for him, his behaivor only seems to be uncontrollable at school settings at home he is tameable. He has been wetting the bed more at night and at school during naptime, the teacher says he wakes up embarrased that he wet his self and refuses to let anyone change him. I don't know what to do for him, If I could have one wish it would    be for my son to have a good behaivor. Please adviseThis discussion is related to4 year old out of Control???.

FAML	5 Year old waking in middle of night	"My boyfriend has 2 daughters (with the same mother), one of which lives with he and I in my apartment. The girl living with us just turned 5, and has seemed to adjust to the new situation relatively well aside from issues with sleeping (been with me for 2 months, and she had been living with Dad and sister for a year, sees Mom every other weekend)... She has positive reinforcement from both of us, she does VERY well in her new school, and her personality has begun to shine. There have not been any major behavioral issues, she is provided with honest answers as to the situation with her Mom and Dad and sister has changed. I work for a pre-school program, and practice parenting skills encouraging free spirit and creativity while maintaining respect for herself, the people and things around her... I am not too strict, but have much more structure and routine in the house than she is used to... With all that said, she has maintained a balanced transition... However, the past couple of weeks she has been waking in the middle of the night, (often times) crying and carrying on... Her Daddy works every other night, so some nights its just me, and others both of us are in the house... So that isn't an issue I think... She claims several different reasons for being awoken. Sometimes its thinking that someone is going to get into the apartment, sometimes its a ""spider"" on the wall, sometimes its thinking she hears people talking... We can calm her down sometimes, but then she usually will come back to wake us or start crying again within 20-30 minutes (sometimes less). We ask how we can help, and she always wants to go into the living room and watch TV... most of the time this helps, but other times she will continue to cry and scream for me, her Daddy, and sometimes her Mommy... I am not positive this is an issue of night terrors, or if this is behavioral and bordering on temper tantrum... We, begrudgingly, tried a tv in her bedroom, but that wasn't good enough (didn't have the right channels, which sent her crying for 45 minutes)... She has spent upwards of 3 hours crying and screaming in her bedroom at 3am before, to the point that I intervined so that she wouldnt make herself sick... Tried comforting, singing, reading new books, disciplining, letting her ""cry it out"", all to no avail... Hoping someone out there has some insight for a distraught Daddy and Step-Mom..."

PREG	how do I deal w/my evil mother in law!	This probably isn't the right place for this, but I figure you gals know me pretty well by now, & most of my friends are guys or aren't married so they don't really understand.So my MIL & I have never really gotten along, & they are coming to visit this Thurs. I'm always being accused of harboring my negative feelings for her, & letting them come up in small ways by making cutting remarks, so I just sent her an email to get everything off my chest before she gets here. She is VERY self-absorbed & selfish -she's the type of person you can tell is NOT listening to a word you're saying, only waiting for you to pause so she can take over the conversation again & talk about herself. This is a woman who bought a brand new BMW 4 mo before our wedding & then said she had no money to help w/our wedding.    Meanwhile, she NEVER DROVE IT!!! It sat in her driveway for over 2 years and had less than 1000 miles on it. So my parents helped us, who have remortgaged their house so many times to pay for my 3 sisters to go to school, that they won't have it paid off til their 80's (but my MIL has almost 1 million in the bank and no mortgage!!! But of course, no money to help w/the wedding!)Anyway, I digress... that's just a SMALL sampling of the kind of person she is.    The thing I'm upset about is that she does not give a flying f*#k about the creation of her future grandchild.    She could absolutely care less.    She never asks how it's going, & even if we tell her something serious is going on, she never bothers to find out how things went. I even emailed her earlier this wk about my low numbers & how this was our first possible chance...do you think she bothered to find out what happened?    NO!!! I just feel like even the women on this forum who I've never met care more about my future baby than she does, & it's really hurtful to me. I know I can't change her, that she will always be COMPLETELY self-absorbed, but it still hurts.
PREG	post methotrexate pain, anyone?	As you all know, I have had a left tubal pregnancy in October of this year. My last ultrasound on December 11th showed that the mass has been decreasing in size (from 8.1 down to 2.8/2.9 cms)I am still experiencing discomfort in my left side (same spot) that increases to sharp pain that lasts a few minutes, then resides to dull discomfort. I have been put on birthcontrol for 3 months, and there is not a chance I could have conceived (refraining from sex). What is this pain? Has anyone else experienced this before? I have posted on Ectopic Pregnancy Forum (www.ectopicpregnancyfoundation.org) hoping for an answer. Please help.

PREG	Help....2 www after IVF	Hey guys. I need help here. I am soooo depressed. I am in my 2 week wait after a 3 day transfer. I took a hpt last night (10 days past transfer) and it was negative. I used the test that has a + to show pregnancy and a - to show not pregnant. I have zero pregnancy signs. All I can do is cry. Anyone out there that has had a IVF pregnancy without signs? Or has anyone taken a hpt and had it be negative, but then turn out to be pregnant on the blood test?
PREG	Role call-who else is getting close?	Hey everyone!    I was just wondering who else is in the homestretch of their pregnancies.    I'm 37 weeks today, and the dr told me at my appt she'd induce me a week early on the 16th, since I'm already 2 centimeters and 75% effaced.    I'm so glad I don't have to worry about being overdue!    What about everyone else, it should be interesting to see who has their baby early, late, etc.
FAML	cerebral palsy girl sits in wet diaper at school	I have a 10 y/o cerebral palsy,nonverbal,wheelchair bound girl who has an aide with her at school. Several times she has come home with a very heavy urine filled diaper. I have addressed it with her teacher, but it doesn't seem to have any affect on the aide. I am very concerned with UTI's and skin break down. As a parent do I have any say on requesting a new aide? I'm afraid if the school district doesn't like my suggestions, they will ask us to go else where.A concerned parent.
DISE	Spinal Injury, painful when sneezing	Good evening WorldMy Name is Raffi, 3 years ago I had a bad car accident where I fell asleep behind the wheel and rolled my car thank G_D I was the only one injured.I broke my Spine and punctured my lungs, I was admitted and went in for an emergency operation fusing my spine from T1-T5 . Apart from all the neurological pains, due to the damage to my spinal cord... No Syrinx, mild Myelomalacia. I am able to walk with no abnormalities and no assistance from walking aids. I do suffer from weak bladder and some neurological symptoms on my left hand side from last rib down > these are improving year by year.I have a MRI every 6 months because of the Myelomalacia and neuro pain and so far no issues.Well I right this with agony, the reason being a few months ago after a gym session I was going out with my friend when I SNEEZED and that is when my life has been hell :( .I was close to going to the hospital after my back muscle between my shoulder blade and spine SPASMED and felt like hot knives shoved in my back ribs and breast.. Since then every time I sneeze I have the same issue and fills like HELL.My GP laughed at me and couldnÃ¢ € ™t understand what I was going through told me to take pain relief and rest..I have not since seen my Neuro or Orthopedic Specialist but they are coming up CAN'T WAIT.I know it is hard to diagnose with the info I have provided but is it likely I have torn a muscle or cause some other issue??I have no new Neuro Pain or new sensitivities, no weakness or pain below my fusion.Any help or advice will help.Much appreciated Raffi
SOCL	Woman charged with hate-crime murder in death of man pushed in front of NYC train	"NEW YORK Ã¢ € ” A 31-year-old Bronx woman who was seen muttering to herself before shoving a man onto subway tracks in front of a speeding train said she did so because, ""I hate Hindus and Muslims,"" prosecutors said.Queens District Attorney Richard A. Brown identified the woman as Erika Menendez, 31. She has been charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime, New York City authorities said. In a statement, Brown said that awaits arraignment in Queens Criminal Court.Menendez admitted to investigators that she pushed Sunando Sen, a 46-year-old Queens resident, on Thursday because of her hatred of Hindus and Muslims, a feeling that stems from Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.Sen was born in India and ran a printing shop. He died Thursday night after being knocked onto the tracks. Police released security camera video showing a woman running from the station.Police said that Menendez was recognized on the street in Brooklyn by a passer-by who called 911. Patrol officers found and arrested her.Brown's statement said that while in custody Menendez made incriminating statements, saying that she ""pushed a Muslim"" onto the tracks. Brown also said:""The defendant is accused of committing what is every subway commuter's worst nightmare - being suddenly and senselessly pushed into the path of an oncoming train. The victim was allegedly shoved from behind and had no chance to defend himself. Beyond that, the hateful remarks allegedly made by the defendant and which precipitated the defendant's actions can never be tolerated by a civilized society.""The attack was the second time this month that someone was pushed to their death in a New York City subway station. A homeless man was arrested in early December and accused of shoving a man in front of a train in Times Square. He is awaiting trial, and claimed he acted in self-defense.Further details on how police managed to identify the suspect in Sen's death were not immediately available.A woman is reportedly in custody in connection with the death of a man who was struck by an oncoming NYC subway.Investigators had been following up on tips from people who had seen the security video and were checking homeless shelters and psychiatric units in an attempt to identify the woman.It was unclear whether Menendez had any connection to Sen. Witnesses told police the two hadn't interacted on the platform as they both waited for the train.http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/12/29/16235799-woman-charged-with-hate-crime-murder-in-death-of-man-pushed-in-front-of-nyc-train"
GOAL	black spot in vision, ash lookin lighting that fades away, twitching and headaches	hi i'm concerned about my left eye i been noticed for several months now on a black spot in my vision i read the other posts to see if anything was mentioned about it but i mean its like u said floaters but here is the trick it doesn't float around its in one spot all the time unless i move my eye ball to the side but it moves with the eye if i look left its not that noticable but i look right its noticable and same when i look straight. i also at times get these ash lookin (is the best way to describe it) spots but it also flickers and seems like ash is really falling in front of me, what i mean by flicker not like a light switch but like a light bulbs electric wire that makes light bright then fades on occasions and that only my left eye my right i have a twitch that i can't say how offten or if there is a pattern because it occures off and on. for example it will twitch one day out of the blue the twitching lasts for about a minute then stops and it happens again and lasts a lil over a minute then stops i tryed to just rub it away maybe its my nerves tightning up but when an eposode happens it tends to drag out for an hour off and on like i said. but that's not my main concern, i'm more worried about my left eye. but would like some advise on whats going on with both of them. i been to eye doctors as a child nothing was detected but i was told to wear glasses when i didn't even need them. i have twenty/ twenty vision so i know what ever is wrong has not affected my vision but i was at age 19 told to were glasses again due to my studies that required being in front of a computer screen for 8 hours a day if not more. and i'm talkin without no breaks. my vision ended up in both eyes becoming blurry like water in my eyes but i had no tears nor water in my eyes they were normal. i also have these bad headaches that are i would have to say by my eyes. i discribed the feeling and where it was coming from to family and a family doctor they said it's a migraine. yet i didn't have sensitivity to light nor noise. just the pain that was coming from the back of my eyes to the front and even the sides like if it could just be a tension headache. i tried over the counter migrain medicine, advil, ibrophin, tylonal, asprin, alieve, a frozen eye mask even nothin seems to work for the pain so i just deal with it. i have never been given an mri on my brain but been told to get one done but i don't know if that would even help either or am i wrong. i have had my head banged up on pavment, concrete, large objects, such as hard cover thick thick books, bats, basically hard objects to the head as i was young and sometimes i get pushed hard where i hit my head on a cabinate door and i have blacked out a couple of times when hit or hit my head i have never been taken to the hospital though to get checked due to me being affraid of doctors and also that trust that i don't have with them. i honestly don't see a doctor unless i have to for a female the yearly check up and to get antibiotics if i have an infection but so you are aware my last visit everything is normal blood and urine came out fine no diabetes, no high cholesterol, nothing not even high blood pressure. the only thing wrong with me is my weight but my health is as if an active healthy weight person if not better just a weight issue. so i am confussed i mean in my family eye problems are a thing but like i said all the eye doctors i have seen said i have perfect vision and there is no need for glasses nor do i have anything wrong with my eyes. i have had a wire hanger jammed into my right eye and that's when i started the twitchin in that eye so i can see that as a reason why my eye twitches. and no i didn't seek medical attention when i got help to remove the hanger and that happened oh i would have to say when i was about 10 1/2 11 years old i am currently 23 years old by the way. back to the headaches i know it has to deal with my eyes since the pain is only coming from my eyes and no where else at times my eye sockets hurt so much that it even hurts to blink my eyes get blood shocked and when they are really bad i end up with nose bleeds. or even wake up with my pillow covered in blood i'm totally concerned and i don't know what to do first when i mention my headaches to my primary physician i get a feeling as if he's not listining so i just gave up and like i said i been dealing with the pain. also the aggitation of the black spot and ash at times in the left eye and twitching in the right. but like the twitchin has been like that for18 or 18 1/2 years so i'm kind of used to it by now. it's just the ash thing and blsck spot but i would like to get you opinion and maybe some advise on what i should do first. headaches are an everyday thing just other days are worse then others i can't tollerate it any more i don't want to have to go my whole life with headaches and wierd eye things going on. so i come to you for your professional oppinion and well some guidance on what i need to do and if its something major or just something mild and can be taken cared of. PLEASE HELP!!!!! i don't know what else to do. and i feel as if i'm not taking the right way about all of this so i would like your help if you can please even if you have no clue on whats wrong at least point me in the right direction as of what i need to do and get done first. thank you for your time. a concerned indevidual

FAML	Help with 3 year old behavior	"So this is my first 3 year old, but I am beside myself.    He is almost 4 years old and I seriously don't know what to do with him.    He is so grouchy and can be just mean to other kids.    He gets so mean and nasty when he thinks that someone is being mean to him or doesn't do what he wants.    I took him to a b-day party tonight and he was playing and then all the sudden I looked at him and he was arguing with a little girl and giving her death looks.    This usually happens the places I take him.    My husband thinks it is normal, but I don't.    He wants to play with other kids, but then has a hard time doing it.    It broke my heart tonight when he came over and said, ""noone wants to play with me.""    But honestly, if he was being nasty to them, I don't blame them.    I have had so many talks with him about being nice to others and I don't know what else to say.    He often thinks he is being funny by making up little phrases and saying them to other kids, ""your a bubblegum head.""    I know that he is just trying to be funny, but other kids don't usually think so and then they are turned off by being around him.    I have also tried to talk to him about this.    He is not a good sharer either.    If there is a toy that he wants, he will not share it, no matter who asks him.    I want him to have friends, but he is making it difficult for others to like him.    Is this normal?    It doesn't seem like other kids are acting this way.    Many of the kids at the b-day party were playing together and having fun.    We take him places that he is around other kids.    He goes to school 2 times a week, I have friends who have kids his age he plays with, we have signed him up for different classes with kids his age.    I just need feedback.    Thank you."
TRMT	Same situation more or less	I also had a breast reduction on jan 4th of this year, just over a week ago. I went back for my week follow-up and informed my doctor of a small lump that I felt in my left breast. He said that he didn't feel anything. Tonight, two days later, I was changing into my pajamas and checked it out in the mirror because it was very painful all day and I instantly noticed a huge swollen lump in the very spot that my doctor said was fine. Do I have breast cancer?This discussion is related toFOUND    A PAINFUL LUMP AFTER BREAST REDUCTION.

I'm just sad I didnt buy it sooner. She will grow out of it soon. I highly recommend.    We gave it to her so we can have a break. It's awesome.I also got her this:http://www.amazon.com/Fisher-Price-Little-Superstar-Sing-Along-Stage/dp/B000NW2AVC/ref=pd_sim_ba_title_25But we havent opened it yet.Anything else anyone can recommend to me? We're short on space so, these are about as big of a toy we can get.    Help!Thanks :)

FAML	she acts like a 2 year old still	I take care of my niece full time as her mother has gone a separate way and my brother has to work full time to support her.I am very worried about her and me and my brother have no clue how to do these things as we were not her main caretaker for four years, and now that we have to be we noticed she wasn't raised up she was kept the same. She just turned four years old, and knows how to use the potty, knows how to keep her panties dry, but she refuses to do them. she picks a diaper or pull-up over her big girl undies. I need help teaching her to do that along with some other things. Now my brother had adhd when he was a kids, and i think she may have it. She stares off into space or watches tv, and when you tell her somthing it takes her 5 times and grabbing somthing from her hands to get her to listen, then she just starts throwing a tantrum or screaming for 15 min.She refuses to sleep in her room, as she has never had to. So she sleeps with me on my air mattress, which is becoming difficult to make sure she isn't falling off the bed every 3 hours.Another problem with bedtime is that we try to get her to sleep at 8- 8:30 but instead she stays awake looking around and bugging me till like 12-1 am.I need help and i am at wits end.

We started living together shortly after my 18th birthday. Everything seemed fine then.    About seven months into the relationship he started to tell me I couldnÃ¢ € ™t go out to eat with my friends, I couldnÃ¢ € ™t call or talk to my friends, and finally it turned into no one. If I wanted to I couldnÃ¢ € ™t do it without telling him before hand and even he had to go with us. I couldnÃ¢ € ™t even call my parents anymore. He check my by bank accounts, my phone call history and text messaging history, and would watch and read all my AIM message I had with my mother. I donÃ¢ € ™t know how to break him of this and set him straight and in his place. If anyone has any comments please help I love him and I want to stay with him I just need to end this. Please Help.

PREG	Baby Hannah is here	Well, after going to the hospital on Monday the 9th to be induced, they started the drip at 7am and let it go till 2pm I went only from 1cm to barely 2 1/2 so he stopped the meds and gave me a pill for the night to help with little contractions.    Well, they restarted the drip on the 10th at about 6am and be broke my water at 10am and I labored pretty hard until 7pm when he decided to go with a c-section because I had only gotten to 6cm.    The baby's head was coning and she wasn't comming down any more do to my hips being to small.    I finally got a epi at 6pm which I thought I was going to die before I got it, was a beautiful thing. lol    Problem was that the chick messed up like three times finally had to have someone else come give it to me, and I think she made me leak spinal fluid I keep getting headaches.    Anyways I ended up having a C-section at 7:00pm and Hannah was born about 7:20pm.    She was only 7.7lbs and 19 1/2inches long, but just to big for these hips.    We are doing good, just got home today, but man i Have a killer headache, so I am going to go lay down for a bit.    Hope everyone is doing well.

TRMT	need your help	I'm 18 years old and I'm tired every second of every day. Even if I sleep for 12 hours I'll still feel weak and really tired the next day. This has been going on for 2 years now. I've been to the doctors and had a blood test and I found out I'm very low on iron. I've been taking 3 iron tablets a day for the last 4 months and theres still no change. I've tried eating foods rich in iron such as red meat as well. I know it sounds stupid but I feel like theres something else wrong with me. Its ruining my life because I can no longer spend as much time with my friends and I'm usually in bed by 7! I need some help but I don't know what other tests the doctor can offer. Please help!
SOCL	Symptoms of Advanced Cirrhosis--Take Two	Oops!    This is the first time I have ever posted on a site, and I forgot to give prospective posters more information; please forgive me.My 47-year-old sister has been drinking heavily for the last 20 years.    About a month ago, during her sixth detox in a year, she suffered a seizure and was out of her head (wet brain?) for about twelve hours in ER.    The hospital ran all sorts of tests and said that her liver enzymes were elevated and the seizure was alcohol-related.    A week ago her ankles became very swollen (she's only about 100 lbs soaking wet, w/the big alcoholic belly) w/one leg swollen all the way to her knee, became jaundiced, and developed ascites.    Her chest is completely covered w/red pimply-looking spider veins.    The doctors drained her abdomen and only retrieved 1.5 liters of liquid.    Her abdomen still looked like she was at least seven months pregnant.    The sonographer said she was still very distended because of her enlarged liver.    She's only eating about one small meal a day; she says it kills her to eat.    She must lie down for about an hour after every meal to relieve her pain.    She is sleeping about 11 hours a day; we don't know if it's due to her new night shift or just another symptom of the cirrhosis.    We've yet to hear the results of her procedure (one week later!) so of course I have been searching the Internet for answers and thinking the worst.    Can anyone offer some answers about what to expect?    Thank you.
TRMT	supposed slipped lap band	I am supposed to have a slipped lap band.    The gp who does the adjustments here in Australia said no slip.    The surgeon who does the lap band surgery, said it was slipped and tomorrow I am getting a second opinion about it - is it slipped or not.I am having no sytmtoms that you would get with a slipped band - pain/problems.I am wondering, is it possible to have a slipped band without pain/complications and if it is replaced, what is the process that you have to go through before/after surgery to get back to eating normal food again.    I have been told two weeks prior to surgery, optifast and two weeks after surgery optifast and then two weeks of pureaed food/straw food.    I am not very keen on optifast and the other one I have the dietician had a problem with because it had to be drunk with skim milk - doesn't think it will decrease the size of the fatty liver.
DEMO	Painful Breasts not Related to Pregnancy or PMS	Hi gals,I'm trying to help myself self-diagnose whatever I have thats goin on... I'm 29 yrs old and I've been experiencing painful/tender breasts since Oct '09. I've gone to the ER thinking it was my heart from shortness of breath and incredible breast pain... all the tests came back normal... I've had numerous blood work done, but have continued to have breast pain/tenderness especially to the touch. I'm currently on Ortho Novum 1/35 and recently went to a OB/GYN to switch my birth control pill and I guess she is going to put me on LoEstrin Fe 1.5/30. I'm hoping that this will help alleviate my symptoms... anyone experience the same sharp painful breasts? What were the doctors saying when you went in? The more tests I want done, the more the doctors keep telling me I'm fine and that I don't need to take anymore tests and that they won't help me anymore, its so frustrating...
SOCL	When do you accept it's over?	I've been with my partner for over 4years.    We live together and have been very happy.    I always felt that there was something missing sexually, and have put it down to the fact that I don't like the way he kisses me.    Sounds pathetic I know, but I really don't and I have never quite known how to tell him, so I don't.    Therefore, we don't do much kissing, which tends to make sex fairly clinical.    Everything else has been great, i thought I was happy.However, I've started to have an affair.    It's very sexual and has now been going on for months.    I have tried to end it, but I have become addicted to the desire and passion which has been missing from my relationship.    I know it is a short term high, and the love I share with my partner is long term, but I can't help thinking without the desire, are'nt you just friends?Following an argument last night, I ask my partner to move out.    He is now out looking for flats and I'm scared I've made a bad call.    More importantly, I think the fact that he has accepted my request without a fight indicates he probably doesnt love me as much as I thought.    Serves me right....
DISE	neck surgery	I had C5 - 7 removed with cage and plating. This was done on 10/27/10. I am almost 6 weeks post op and have burning up the left side of my neck. Prior to the surgery the numbness was on the right side and the head aches were unbelievable. The head aches and right side numbness is totally gone. I've read that the burning is common and will disappear. My new problem is I can't wear anything close to my neck. It feels like there is something pressing against my throat. My NS is very cautious. I am still in the hard collar 50% of the day and at night when I sleep. I wear a bone growth stimulator 24/7 for 6 months. Does anyone else have this problem with there throat?

DEMO	Saga of the Ever Changing Discharge	The more I research, the more confused I get, so maybe someone has something similar:In April, I was diagnosed with vaginal strep, which consisted of a creamy, grayish discharge that was sometimes thick and other times thin with what looked like gray clumps in it.    There was intense itching and a distinct, nonoffensive smell.    There was no redness of the vulva, no pain during urination.    I was treated, and supposedly it went away, althought there was a profuse white discharge afterwards (what I assumed and treated as a yeast infection).In late June, the same discharge/odor/itch/no pain during urination came back, and I assumed it was the same strep infection.    I did not treat it this time, and it went away.Now (Aug 30), I have a new perplexing situation:    After my period ended earlier this week, there was an intense itching with a thick, clumpy discharge.    It looked mucopurulent (thick, hint of yellow), itched, no odor, no pain during urination.    I had sex (itching afterwards, which I realize is worrisome) with my boyfriend, who is a diabetic and has no symptoms.    In the morning, there was some slightly brown, thin discharge (assuming from me being dry and rough mutual masturbation?)    Then in the early afternoon, the discharge changed to thin and yellow (less itching, no pain during or change in frequency of urination), and now it has a foul smell (it reminds me of mulch or walking through the botanic gardens... odd).    I have a doc appointment scheduled for next week, but was curious in the meantime... has anyone has similar symptoms or a diagnosis?    Thank you so much, I appreciate it!

FAML	Childhood masterbation(masturbation) mystery	I know this is a little different than normal. My question is not about my child but my childhood. I have been reading the posts of parents whose children frequently masterbate. I am 31 years old and I am dealing with morbid obeasity. I think it is linked to my childhood masterbation(masturbation). I don't remember when I started I think about 3    but at some point my sister did it with me. I think about 7 or so she is 2 years younger.    I am not sure why or how this started but I would straddle her and rub against her until I got off, at other times she was on top. I also rubbed against anything else I could find. I was obsessed with sex and had sexual thoughts about men in my family. I knew that this was wrong but I couldn't stop it. I always felt like there was something wrong with me and I was bad. I reacently asked my mom if I was sexually abused but she says there is no way because she was too overprotecive. I know this is a long question but I am desprate for an answer. Is what I experianced as a child normal or did I sexually abuse my sister?

FAML	Kindergarden Crazy	I have a 5 year old little girl. She is a only child, but I have taken her to story time and had her in preschool. Now that she started Kindergarden a month ago, her behavior is off the charts. She is yelling out in class, misbehaving in line, cutting her clothing, lying about everything (huge lies with plots and organiztion, even consequences). She has always been a bright child and knows every thing they are currently teach, but the socail skills. She has been kicked out of class twice this week and the school has told me that she is scaring the other kids. She knows right from wrong, she says that she has funny wiggles in her and that is why she can't behave.This is a complete change from how she acted before the start of school. I talk to her, I give her positive reenforcement. The teacher and I are communicating everyday. I need help!! How can I show her a connection between good choices and good things (books, playground, shoping, playdates).

FAML	Toddler with flat feet	My 14 month-old had flat feet. This is causing her to walk on the inside of her feet. When she is standing straight, her legs (from the knees down) appear to angle out because she is standing with her weight on the insides of her feet. Our pediatrician says that she will grow out of it but may need orthodics in the future. We also took her to a foot doctor who said the same thing. My concern is waiting until she is 2 or 3 years old and then being told we should have done something earlier because now it's too late. Is there a risk of causing permanent damage to her knee and/or ankle joints or to her growing bones? Should she be evaluated for braces or orthodics now? Any I just a worried first time mom??Thank you in advance for your time and advise.

DEMO	nipple ulceration, scared of Paget's	i woke up 3 weeks ago with a small ulceration on my right nipple. it had grown from 1 mm in diameter to 3 mm in diameter in a couple of days and appeared infected and a second ulceration appeared beside it, so i went to the doctor. the wound did weep yellow fluid after it would get wet. there was no discharge or itching, but my nipple was extremely sensitive. i had assumed it was because of the open wound. i took a weeks worth of keflex and she cultured the ulceration and ordered an ultrasound. everything came out normal. it has healed, but there was no conclusion for what had happened. my right nipple is enlarged and deformed. the areola skin is now dry and i feel a pain that comes and goes in my right breast.my doctor keeps telling me to watch it for a month to see if anything changes before she will refer me to a specialist. i am terrified this may be a sign of paget's disease of the nipple or DCIS. would paget's have responded to antibiotics? what could be any possible reasons for this?i am not pregnant and do not have children. i am 23 years old and my last mens was 01/19/10.any answers or insight will give me some slight piece of mind. thank you in advance for your immediate reponse!

TRMT	H1N1 vaccine?	I am strongly against any and all flu vaccines and have been my whole life.    I have never had one nor have my 9 and 5 year old kids.    Well my wife joined the panic bandwagon and just had to get it done.    My son they would only give the nasil which made me even more angry.    But the point to my question is that my 9 year old daughter who has cough variant asthma had her shot and 1 hour later she collapsed to the floor and was out for about 30 seconds.    Whites in eyes showing.    She came to and the ambulance was pretty much at the house.    They took her to ER and they did EKG, chest X-Rays, blood work and a few other tests.    Every thing came back normal and they said she must have just passed out due to anxiety or something due to the shot.    The Dr gave me the most political answer when I asked if this could be a side effect to the shot.    She has never passed out in the 9 years she has been around all of a sudden she gets a vaccine and boom.    I just want a honest answer.    Becuase the medical field does not want people to think vaccines are dangerous and when something does happen it seems like they try to hide it to not scare the rest of the community.    Any answers would be great.    Thank you

TRMT	Problems breathing since I started dieting	I'm a 22 year old female, I weigh 209.5 lbs currently (weighed 215 lbs on Nov 8th when I started my diet plan), and I'm 5'2'' tall. I now exercise 45 minutes 4 times a week and aiming to every day of the week. When I calculated my BMR (according to moderately active since I started exercising and I move a lot at home with my two little kids), it was 2440.My diet plan is eating 1440 calories a day, and exercising as mentioned above. I should mention that before starting on Nov 8th, I had not exercised or done anything close to exercising (not even walking, I hardly ever go out since I had my kids), and I started with 45 minutes of light calisthenics (focusing on abs, legs, and arms - Tracy Anderson method for post-pregnancy exercise). I have also noticed that I usually reach only 50% of my needs of Calcium, Iron, and Potassium per day.About a week ago, I started to feel suddenly unable to breath right, not while exercising or after it, just arbitrarily. I just feel like I can't take a good deep breath for a short while and it comes and goes throughout the day. Can this be related to my diet or exercising? Maybe due to low iron intake? Although I have had mild anemia when I was pregnant, never got it checked again after that and stopped taking iron pills after childbirth. Any thoughts?
GOAL	Different Sized Pupils	I am a bit concerned.It all started over three months ago with tingling on my right shoulder, my left knee down, left arm (elbow down), back of the neck (at times) and tailbone area.    Headaches are pretty much a daily occurance (at time I would explain them to be migraines). I've had some leg pain in my left leg, almost as if it feels like it's been worked out a bit too much (although, I don't work out).    I have blurred vision periodically throughout the day. I tire very easily, two hours after I wake up I feel exhausted and need a nap. Increased visual floaters.    I seem to get into these spells where I feel like I am in a complete daze, perhaps what they call brain fog. Now, the most recent I've noticed is different sized pupils (periodically throughout the day). The list goes on.My initial research led me to beleive that I have MS considering it started with vertigo and tingling.    I have seen a neuro and all tests came back normal including my MRI tons of blood work all came back normal no signs of inflammation.    The only test that came back a bit iffy was my cortisol levels I was on the very low end of the normal scale.Do you think the most recent symptom (different sized pupils) is a cause for concern?Here is what my MRI report said:BRAIN MRI results:Clinical Information: Patient describes headaches, mild dizziness, blurred vision with numbness and tingling in the lower back, left upper extremity and left lower extremity.Technical Information: Sagital FLAIR, axial T2, axial proton density, axial FLAIR, axial T1 post-gadolinium, and diffusion-weighted imaging of the brain was performed.    During the emamination, Omniscan 12cc was administered.Interpretation: MR imaging of the brain reveals three punctate foci of long TR signals abnormality within the left frontal lobe subcortial white matter as seen on series 4, images 3 and series 6, image 19.    Phase artifact is superimposed over the left tempral lobe.    Mild symmetric hyperintensity marginates the anterior and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles attributed to failed CSF suppression.    Prominent perivascular spaces are present withn th eanterior perforated substnce. No corpus callosal periventricular radiating lesions characteristic of a demyelinating process are identified.    There are no enhancing lesions within the brain parenchyma to suggest and active infammatory process.    Thereis no abnormal intrcranial mass or mass effect.    The cerebral sulci appear symmetric and age appropriate.    The ventricals are not dilated.    The basal and cisterns are not effaced.    Flow voids are present within the cavernous carotids and vertebrobasilar system.    The cerebellar tonsils are not low lying. A retension cyst is present with the lateral recess of the left phenoid sinus.Conclusion:1. Three nonspecific punctate foci of long TR signal abnormality within the left frontal lobe white matter.2. No evidence of acute/subacute infarct.3. No abnormal intercranial mass or mass effect.4. A rentention cyst within the lateral recess of the left sphenoid sinus.CERVICAL SPINE MRI results:Conclusion:1. No abnormal signal or enhancement within the cervical cord to suggest a demyelinating process.2. Mild multilevel degenerative disc disease in the mid and lower cervical spine without critical degenerative spinal canal or neural foraminal narrowing.3. No facet arthropathy.
DISE	Possible Brugada ?	I am very frustrated concerning my 38 year old daughter. She has mitral valve prolapse with regurgitation. They have been watching it for some time now doing echo's and TEE's. The cardiologist    says that it is getting worse now , it has become severe and she started to look for options for surgery. Her insurance won't let her go outside NYS so she cant go to Cleveland Clinic where her Dr. wanted her to go. The hospital that was chosen was Strong Memorial in Rochester NY. Well she had the consult and actually set up surgery thinking that both leaflets in the valves are shot and that they would be repaired. The surgeon reviewed the previous tests and he did an echo and he is not in agreement with my daughter's cardiologist he feels that it is moderate and not severe. He told us that you never do heart surgery to early because of the risks and you have to watch to make sure you don't do it late either. They wanted her to do a stress echo which she just did. That was what his findings were that he feels it is just moderate and not time to do the surgery.When she had the stress echo done the Dr. told her that when she started she had all these extra beats that were all over the place and she should have that looked into. I need to give you some past on my daughter. She went into cardiac arrest 4 years ago. They feel it seemed like because her potassium was low. It was a miracle that she pulled out of it. It happened when she was driving her four small children. They implanted a defibrillator and nothing has happened since. The cardiologist looked at her stress echo and had another Dr look at her results and he said that with her past history, he feels she may have Brugada syndrome and wants her to look into this. We have gone from one bad thing to another. What I am searching for is what tests are done to find out if you have this? Are they accurate tests or dangerous? Has anyone ever had heart surgery with this disorder and have had positive results from it. Any help would be greatly appreciated please.

PREG	concern about retrival for IVF	Today I went in for my u/s and I am kind of concern because it looks like I'm going to have two large follices and two very small ones. The two large ones are exactly the same size which is 18.3.    I'm doing ICSI, but I'm worried that i'm going to go through retrieval and find out the next day that none of them made it because they are probably going to only be able to retrive two.    My question is has anyone gone through retrieval with a small amount of follicles and have them all fertilize? This is so hard.
SOCL	Vaginal Pain In Need of help!	Hello,I'm a 19 year old female who has been having mysterious vaginal pain for about a year. I had never had sex until last year with my boyfriend. We were both virgins and so we started off without using condoms. I kept pushing for it but every time we did use one I felt a burning sensation. It took me awhile to realize what was happening. It wasn't until I threw him across the room and felt like someone had poured acid on me did I think I might have a latex allergy. I burned for 4 days and on the 5th day I broke out into hives all down my back, bottom and back of my legs. Since then I have not been able to have sex without extreme burning. It got to a point where I would break out into tears while we had sex. I've been to gynecologist who assumed I wasn't using lube which I have been. I found a sight about vaginismus and it seemed similar. With mental work I have made it easier to have sex but I still am so dry even with lube. I burn after and have to wash myself immediately. I swell up and going to the bathroom feels like someone just slice me open down there. I have been checked for everything under the sun. At least 6 times within the last year all coming back normal. I get yeast infections a lot though and an intense dryness that just wont go. I went to a doctor and I have been given three different types of vaginal steroid cream none which have helped if anything they made my skin more sensitive. I have been using a vitamin E cream but it hasn't seemed to help much. My boyfriend is scared to touch me now and I am terrified for him to touch me. I recently went on antidepressants which the depression I think has come from this a lot but I feel as though I have gotten dryer more recently. I can't live like this. I burn after any sexual act and I become in flamed. I have had latex testing and it has all come back negative but they believe I am allergic still. I live in Canada and could go to a doctor if I could find on that really wanted to help me. Please someone, anyone. A Doctor please please help me give me a clue I am desperate to understand what is happening with me. Tell me what to do how to fix this I just need something anything to manage this.    Thank you.
SOCL	Negative Rh factor	I have a Negative Rh factor and my husband is positive. I believe my daughter is negative. What are the chances that our other children will be negative?

TRMT	hysterectomy gone wrong	my sister had a hysterectomy coming up to 2 years this may, an she has never recovered. she has seen countless doctors, an been back for keyhole surgery since, an has never been told exactly what has happened. She is now in a wheelchair, an suffers constantly with unbearable, an only what she can describe as severe pressure pain, and she feels as though she is dragging her stomach behind her. She is now on mophine, an a lot of paracetamol. She doesnt get any relief hardly with the pain, an cannot do anything at all for herself. It was supposed to be a straightforward hysterectomy, and a large fibroid removed, but this has turned into a nightmare. Before she had this op, she worked full time. Can you help in anyway. Ann
GOAL	iris turning white	I just noticed the top of my iris in both eyes have turned milky white in color. (I have brown eyes) It is about 1 mm in width and extends over the tpo portion of both eyes. Could this be due to improperly fitted contacts? or some other eye problem?    The reason I noticed it is because I examined my eyes after my contacts ( 1 month wear) seemed to be irritating my eyes- had itchy, slightly red eyes for about 1 1/2 weeks then started wearing glasses
GOAL	Left Eye problem - cannot figure it out	I only have problems with my left eye. I constantly day in and day out have irritation and pull strings of yellow and white out. I have even pulled black stings over one inch out that have black calcified balls on them. It feels as if floaters of blurred goo pass over the eye and I cannot see most of the time. The mucus I pull out is very thick and murcky feeling and feels as if there is no end - I can literally feel it coming from behind the eye. There is constant pain behind my left eye, pain in the left nasal passage which becomes very stuffy, pain in the cheek bone and left ear. It feels like pink eye and I have all of the symptoms except for the actual pink. If you look at eye you can see yellow discoloration on the eyelid and under it looks like I have a constant black eye. I have tried to track everything from out door pollutants, to food or certians surroundings and nothing. I have seen so many doctors and I have not gotten help.

GOAL	Muscular Calves?!	I have been running for about 6 months now, I started off slow and only covered about 1km or so and now I'm doing up to 4km. I am tall so a faster pace is always easier for me and I sometimes throw one or two sprints in the distance.What I have noticed recently though is that my calves are looking pretty bulky!! It is annoying me because I am a teenage girl and bulky limbs don't look too good.I have been running quite regularly recently since getting an exercise buddy and I usually cover 3-4km run with two sprints in it and a 5-10minute brisk hill walk and then a ten minute slow walk to cool down.If this is how I exercise 3-5times a week, what can I do to avoid getting very bulky calves and adding to my built look and also any tips for quickly cutting down inner thigh fat?Thanks so, so much! xx

PREG	Pregnant with NO SPERM???	"Hello everyone,In Sept. I had a laparotomy done for stage 4 endo and cysts. After that my obgyn sent me to a fertility doc b/c she said the ends of my tubes looked ""clubbed"" (the finger-like things were shorter). So fertility doc said IVF would be my best option b/c I am high risk for ectopic pregnancy. Well, I went for workup blood and we found out I was pregnant. It was however an ectopic pregnancy. But here's where it gets strange, my husband went in for a semen anaylisis and it came back NO SPERM! Now he had smoked marijuana a week before this test, so the dr. scheduled another one for a month later, which was today, he has not smoked marijuana in about 2 months but his anaylisis came back no sperm again!!! How can he have no sperm and I got pregnant??? I am faithful to my husband, I have NEVER strayed. They told me that the marijuana could have been a cause and sometimes could take 3 months or so to leave system, however at the time I had gotten pregnant he was using marijuana almost everyother day. ( i have since fought with him to quit which he has) Andwhen I told the Dr. that she didnt really have an answer. Has anyone ever heard of a semen anaylisis comming back twice no sperm but the female had been pregnant a month before???"
GOAL	Enlarged, tired eyes & visual problems?	I'm under 40 years old.    My eye prescription is -11.5 and -9.5.    Diameter = 14.0.    I wear regular (not toric) contacts.    I    had surgery a few years ago to stop a slight retinal tear.    The tear was diagnosed early and follow up visits have been completed with no issues.    I use the computer daily. I look at small computerized text and small print all the time.The problem:My clarity & distance vision seem to be getting worse - although I still read about the same on the eye chart test.    My peripheral vision is distorted.    When people walk close to me from a side angle, or are directly in front of me (maybe around 1-2 feet away from me), it's near impossible for me to maintain eye contact without blinking often or feeling 'cross-eyed'.     I blink a lot to 'refocus' my vision.    I have extreme light sensitivity. My eyes look big.    They look    unfocused & HUGE (like 'deer in headlights') in photos.    They looked normal in photos a few years ago.    One eye looks slightly larger than the other in recent pictures.    Doctor measurements say the pupils are within the same size range.    My eye lids are basically normal.    One doctor suggest one eye lid hangs very slightly lower - making the amount of 'white' of one eye less prominent    - making the eye appear smaller than the other.    Occassionally, I have headaches (not migraines) on only one side of my head.    My eyes are always a tired, strained and sometimes red.    I don't have any eye pain worth mentioning.    One eye 'pulses' or 'ticks' sometimes. Since retinal tear surgery, I have an occassional small 'floater'.    I occassionally see 'ripples of light' within one eye.    When it happens, it's kind of like how the material within a LCD computer monitor screen 'displaces' and 'spreads out' when you run your finger down the LCD screen...    How I view color:    One eye sees a white paper as a slight tighted or off white, compared to the other eye.    I passed every eye test (color blindness tests, visual field, optic nerve, retinal test) that my multiple eye doctors gave me.    They think my eyes are just getting old.    CAT scans were not done, since my symptoms are too vague.    My primary care doctor ran blood tests to rule out thyroid and autoimmune stuff - and couldn't find a problem.    I'm tired of doctors, but think something is not right.    Your thoughts?

PREG	Help! I need advice	I had unprocted sex on feb 26/27, we used a condom but half the time we also didn't use one. I kno pre-*** can make a pregnancy occur but I think the chances are slim. I was supposed to get my period on March 13th, but i still didn't get it up to day. It's 9 days late and counting. I am experiencing terrible back pain, my breasts are so sore they hurt every time I roll over in bed. I didn't gain weight, a lil bit of nauseau but no vomitting. No weird food cravings, and now I'm getting a white creamy discharge, just a very little. My period never been this late before, I'm planning on taking a pregnancy test by next week Tuesday and a blood test later that week. May my body just be fooling me that im pregnant? It sometimes feels like it's all in my head yet these symptoms r really happening.
DEMO	Pain where breast and armpit meets	I am 28 and have been exp. pain that started on the right side of my left breast about four months ago. I didn't injure it but I thought I might have so I have given it some time to heal. However, I had the flu over the fourth of July and was at a funeral and my breast/chest hurt very badly along with extreme dizziness and feeling like I didn't drink my V8 juice (you know where they walk sideways because they didn't have their V8). I felt like/sometimes still do, feel like I'm just going to topple over.    But I didn't have it checked. Over the past four months, this pain has grown from that orginating spot, up, above my left breast, up through to my collar bone on top, over to my far left shoulder tip (to where the shoulder looks a little dislocated), and esp. hurts in my armpit/breast region. I also have had pain under my left breast, by where I think the rib cage ends. There is a protrusion there, like the bottom of my rib cage has a bit of bone that sticks out. That started about seven years ago. I had a NP look at it and she felt it too. My right side is not like that. I have had problems wearing bras because of this. There was a mammogram and Cat scan done back then, but everything was fine and the NP said she didn't know what is was. I was young and have been living with that pain for a while and didn't insist on getting an answer.    It goes into my back shoulder blade, where it hurts to breathe lately. Today, my current NP ordered x-rays of my shoulder although I told her it felt like my glands were swollen. The x-rays were fine. Has anybody had something similiar or maybe have an inkling of how I can approach figuring this out? I will do the mammogram and utlrasound the NP has set up for me, but what if this shows nothing? It's like they tell you you waited to long to come to the doctor for pain relief but other times they tell you you came too soon. Screwed if you do and screwed if you don't. I don't want to do anything crazy but this pain is limiting my life-I can pretty much only lay in bed because if I'm asleep then I won't have to deal with the terrible pain. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

PREG	teacher or student? maybe a little of both!	"My daughter who just turned 5 in April started kindergarten. She has never been to preschool or daycare as I am a stay at home mom. On her assessment test she scored a little low and the teacher acted like maybe I should hold her until she was 6 but then I talked to the counselor who assured me my dd would get intervention and be caught up.Her teacher called me at home from her home after only the fifth full day of school and wanted to discuss some things with me. The first thing is that my daughter had her shoe off for whatever reason and took her shoe to the teacher and just held it to her b/c she needed help putting it back on but she wouldn't ask,I should add my child is very shy and reserved especially in a public setting, the teacher told me she asked my child what she needed a few times and she wouldn't answer so she took her out in the hall and sat her down and and told her if she wanted her shoe back on she would have to ask so my child screamed ""put my shoe on"" and was upset. The next thing is that she asked them all (there are 26 kids in this class) to take out the blue crayon and my daughter took out pink (she knows her colors) and refused to get blue out so the teacher took the pink crayon away from her and this upset my daughter. She also told me my child has a hard time following 3 and 4 part directions and that that concerns her. She told me it may be a good idea to talk to my child dr. about this. She made me cry because she is acting like there is something wrong with my child! I had a talk with my daughter and she has been doing better on her behavior and at listening to her teacher but the teacher says she is still not catching on like the other children and to talk to her Dr. this concerns me. Is there something wrong with my child? The teacher says my daughter is the only one out of 26 kids to have these issues, is that believable? This is only her second week of any kind of schooling is this teacher jumping the gun? I feel like she has already singled my child out. Sorry this is so long but I am lost, this is the first child I have ever put in school. Any advice will be great!Thanks in advace,Lauren"
PREG	Ashtyn Update..... :-(	Saturday I had to take Ashtyn to Urgent Care because his ear was tender and he was screaming a lot. Well, they told me he had ear infection in both ears and put him on amoxicilin. Well, he was not getting any better and he was throwing up everything he was eating so I took him to the ped. She told me that his ear drum has ruptured and put him on a liquid version of the Z-pack that adults take. Basically a strong antibiotic!So, besides that, he is 6 months old today!

TRMT	What can someone do when a diastasis is causing all types of medical problems; pa...	Good Evening Everyone!I have been desperately searching the web for some hope regarding my diastsis and the associated problems from it. I had back surgery in 2006 after having my son in 2005. I look like I am between 6 and 8 months pregnant and there is a physically visible and unquestionable separation of the abdominal muscles. I have digestive problems and have been on COPIOUS amounts of dangerous painkillers so that I can work (against doctor's recommendations) through the pain. I feel that my only chance to lose this hanging weight and lack of strength around my middle and get off these pills is to have this surgery. However, I cannot afford to pay for plastic surgery. What are the chances my insurance will pay? I have had a c-section and back surgery (lumbar area) and there is ZERO muscle tone to hold anything in. I have been put on anti depressants because of all of this and the meds I take (aside from their dangerous nature just because of what they are) cost my insurance between $1,000 and $1200 per month as it is. Any advice at all will be so appreciated as I have been depressed and in pain just thinking I was fat and deformed until I read about the diastasis. Now I feel there is hope, IF I can get my insurance to cover it...I am going to post most of this online as well in the hopes that more people can offer me guidance. Thanks again for your time, take care!I want to get my life back; end the pain, get off these dangerous meds, and feel good about myself again. Maybe stop being depressed too...?!
DISE	DO I have fibro?	"Hi, I'm new to this site, but I hope to get some helpful info. I am very confused on what could be wrong with me. I am 30 and I have had problems since I was 10. Most of the Drs that I have seen have pretty much looked passed me, plus it doesnÃ¢ € ™t help that I didnÃ¢ € ™t have just one dr. Anyway, I have a few problems that I know for sure. I have 3 heart conditions.....SVT (about 200 and above), MVP, murmur. I have ""attacks"" where I have rapid heart beat, body shakes, hyper ventilating, lose awareness (almost like fainting symptoms), dizzy, light headed, and I get a flush feeling over my body.    I have no warning and no time to take action before they happen, I can sometimes have one or have them back to back.    I can go months without one or have them constantly, IÃ¢ € ™ve had two node ablations, insertion and removal of loop recorder, none of which have solved my problems.I also have degenerative bone disease (but IÃ¢ € ™ve never had any treatment for it), IBS, Carpal Tunnel, Arthritis, and chronic UTI.    Now the reason IÃ¢ € ™m on this site is because I have a lot more problems that IÃ¢ € ™m worried about, I have constant pain everyday, I know it sounds stupid but itÃ¢ € ™s true.    My major pain right now is in my left knee and both my ankles, and my skin hurts at a light touch.    I can not use my left thumb; I canÃ¢ € ™t even open the door with my left hand.    I feel like I have creepy crawlers in my legs, and when I try to relax at night my legs jump out of nowhere.    I have a very high pain tolerance, but I donÃ¢ € ™t know how much more I can take.    I donÃ¢ € ™t have health insurance so I donÃ¢ € ™t know what to do, any advice would be wonderful.I donÃ¢ € ™t know if this helps but my grandmother does have fibromyalgia, Is it hereditary?    Thanks for all of your help."

DISE	Can arrythmias lead to a heart attack?	"I am being worked up for chest pains/discomfort. I have periods feelings of a feeling of being punched in the center of the chest (between by breasts) which lasts for a few seconds to a few minutes.    I have never had any radiating pain and this always happens at rest. This has been happening for about 7 months.I also get a fluttering feeling, not at the same time as the above symptom, that lasts for seconds to minutes, take my breath away, might happen several times a day, or I might not have the feeling for a couple weeks.    I have had 2 negative EKGs and a negative stress test.    I can't ever get to a health professional while I am actually having the smptoms because they only last for seconds to a few minutes.    The longest period I have gone with daily symptoms is three weeks, but due to the HMO system I could not get to a cardiologist in time to get a Holter.    I was not going through any unusual stress during this period.    Now I haven't had the syptoms(symptoms)for 2-3 weeks, finally got into a cardiologist and she is saying she thinks it is stress arrythmias.    We are waiting for approval for a Holter monitor & she told me to contact the office when I have the fluttering, but like I said, it only lasts a few seconds.    What test can be done to ""catch"" these symptoms?How serious are arrythmias? Can this lead to a heart attack? These symptoms don't happen when I'm ""stressed out"" so why would it be stress arrythmias?"

PREG	Totally Bloated and Sleepy on 11dpo	Ho hum. So, I'm 11 dpo/cd28 and got a neg with a FRER. I am sooo bloated today. I never get bloated before AF.    I haven't had any cm most of the TWW, but starting yesterday I have watery cm. I'm soooo tired! And I also have a headache, but I think these might be due to my allergies. My sinuses are sore when I press on them, so I know I'm dealing with spring allergens. I still have a low grade pukey feeling on and off. BBs are sore, but not as badly as yesterday. Just want to know if this is AF coming or not. I think tomorrow's test will be the tell-all. I feel like if I'm going to get an accurate test it's going to be on 12dpo and that's tomorrow. Not feeling terribly hopeful at this point :0(SSBD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!~Sue
TRMT	Working on increasing fiber in diet, but...	Alright, I went to the doctor with complaints about sharp pains in my abdomen. Usually they start on my upper left side quite intensly and I'll feel it in the right side a little later and less intensly. After that I'll get a general discomfort all around my lower abdomen (not on any side in particular).My doctor suggested I add more fiber to my diet (I'm a vegetarian so I tend to eat a lot already), get a source of psyllium which I can get through eating Kelloggs All Bran Buds in the morning, and cutting out beans and lentils which may be giving me some gassy problems and making my pain worse.The thing is that I don't really think that fiber is my problem, although my digestive system seems to be working rather slowly... my stools aren't really hard when they come out... just hard to get out. Sometimes I even have diarrhea. So does this mean my problems might be more gas related? And what should I substitute for beans so that I can still get a good source of protein?
DISE	parathryoid issue?  This isn't posting my results?	I got my test results back.    It is quite interesting.    Last month my thyroid antibodies were above 250 and this month they (anti-thy perox) were 25 with reference    30)So he said Monday we will discuss the vitamin D which is low and the marginal parathyroid results.    Does this mean I have a problem with it or not?    From what I read, your calcium levels should really never be in the 10's and even with a normal PTH is is suggestive of parathyroid issues.    Is this true?    Could this be why I am having panic attacks, raised blood pressure, headache and side effects to my thyroid meds?    Once again thank you all for the help.    I don't know what I would do without you all.

SOCL	Satellite's doom set for Friday	"http://cosmiclog.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/09/21/7879772-satellites-doom-set-for-friday#c58247359No more ""plus or minus"": NASA says its derelict Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite is definitely making its final fiery plunge to Earth on Friday.For two weeks, experts on orbital debris has been telling people that the 20-year-old, bus-sized spacecraft would soon fall through the atmosphere and drop about two dozen pieces of debris on Earth Ã¢ € ” but until this morning, there was too much uncertainty to say exactly which day that would happen. In today's update, NASA says it will be Sept. 23, U.S. time.""The time reference does not mean that the satellite is expected to re-enter over the United States,"" the update said. ""It is simply a time reference. Although it is still too early to predict the time and location of re-entry, predictions of the time period are becoming more refined.""--------------------------------------------------------------------------------The six-ton satellite's orbit is limited to between 57 degrees north latitude and 57 degrees south, spanning the width of the world between northern Canada and the tip of South America. In the past, Nicholas Johnson, the head of NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office, has estimated that the chances that any of the UARS debris would hit anybody were 1 in 3,200 Ã¢ € ” which translates into a 1-in-20 trillion risk for any particular person (you, for example, unless you're living in, say, Finland ... in that case there's zero risk).Now that the time frame for the fall has been refined, you could theoretically tweak those odds, as well as the likely fall zone, to match the satellite's orbital track for Friday. But NASA's Johnson won't take on that exercise.""At that point, we don't compute odds,"" he told me today. The satellite will simply fall where it falls.From here on in, NASA and its partners at the U.S. Strategic Command will be issuing updates on the timing at 24 hours before the expected fall, T-minus-12 hours, T-minus-6 hours and T-minus-2 hours Ã¢ € ” and we'll be passing those predictions along. But even two hours before re-entry, experts won't be able to project exactly where the debris will end up.When UARS' predicament first came to light a couple of weeks ago, Johnson said the margin of error for the 500-mile (800-kilometer) fall zone would be somewhere around 6,000 miles, or a quarter of the way around the planet. The uncertainty arises because of a couple of factors: Solar outbursts, like the ones we've been getting over the past few weeks, lead to a faster decay of orbits for low-flying spacecraft. Also, the satellite is tumbling, which leads to unpredictable atmospheric-drag effects. Because there's no fuel left for orbital maneuvering, no one has any control over UARS' orbital course.Most of the satellite will burn up in the atmosphere, but NASA estimates that about a half-ton's worth of fragments will survive re-entry and fall to Earth. The computer models suggest that the biggest chunk would weigh about 300 pounds (150 kilograms), or as much as a refrigerator. Anyone who happened to be in the vicinity of the debris fall would see bright streaks in the sky, much like the fireworks seen when pieces of Russia's Mir space station fell to Earth in 2001.The most likely outcome is that the remnants of the UARS satellite would fall into a desolate patch of ocean or an uninhabited stretch of land, far away from any witnesses or potential victims. ""Throughout the entire 54 years of the Space Age, there has been no confirmed report of anybody in the world being injured or severely impacted by any re-entering debris,"" Johnson noted two weeks ago."

DISE	what could this be-New to forum	Last week, I had a ct scan of the abdomen because my endocrinologist wanted to view my adrenal glands. Over the last 7 months, I have had a series of neurological issues that include tingling, numbness, internal tremors, and muscular type pain. I have been worked by up 2 neuros, rheumatologist, endo, PCP, ENT, cardiologist, ID, etc. The endo thinks that I could be developing Grave's Disease. As a result of this, she sent me for the CT scan of the abdomen. She called me on yesterday and told me that the test revealed a 4 cm non-specific mass behind my pancreas and in front of the aorta. I have not had any nausea, dizziness, constipation, etc. I have low Vitamin D and was dx with Epstein Barr virus. I also have an increased ESR. Please let me know what you think this could be.Thanks,Regina
GOAL	IOL Post-op Problem	About two days after cataract surgery my eyes, which normally tear well felt very dry and very uncomfortable felt like I had worn hard contact lenses too long.    At the same time, I developed laryngitis, an ear ache and sinusitis, which started on the operated side and progressed to encompass my whole head. Pain was more pronounced on the operation side feeling like eye strain emanating from the socket, with an occasional fleeting sharp pain which has slowly reduced.My ENT did a thorough exam and ended up doing a CT and found no infection and ruled out allergies or a cold.    All along, I had no fever and my sinuses were clear, just an ongoing post-nasal drip.I have been plagued with ear aches in both ears and intense pressure behind both eyes, with throbbing in all all of my sinus cavities.    I had to take antivert when the pressure caused severe dizziness.    I started a short strong regimen of prednisone to alleviate some of the symptoms but even medicated, the area around the eyes feels intense pressure and throbbing. When I awake there is sometimes a feeling of dryness and a low dull pain.All that said, I have no problems with the implant. I see very well with that eye.I don't know where else to go to from here.

TRMT	Hyperthyroidism after Bariatric surgery?	Hi, I am a 52 year old woman who was always suspected of hypothroidism. I have always had a weight problem but, because I always ate healthy, no sugar, no salt mostly veggies and salads. Never was a meat eatter, always had to eat several egg whites a day for protein.Doctors really need to look further than at a persons body size in considering what is wrong. Not all heavy people eat alot or improperly. And    heavy people obviously can have Hyperthyroidism. Under-treated or untreated Hyperthyroidism is bad. For years I have had many symptoms of thyroid probs, both hypo and hyper. Eyes bulging out of head, extreme fatigue alternating with hyperacvtivity,brittle hair(used to have such good hair salons never wanted to cut it), heart palpitations,dry eyes, constant fainting, Have not had to tweeze eyebrows in 10 years, barely any hair on legs and underarms, insomnia and etc. I have always had very low blood pressure and was recently told it was too low,, low sugar(glucose),;ow cholesterol, all indicative of how I eat , not what was assumed because of my size and rapid weight gain weekly. I went to doctor and told him my symptoms, at first he giggled and said by looking at you I know you do not have hyperthyroids.How rude and condascending, once again I was just a fat person who all of my problems were that I was fat, not thinking for once the weight was a symptom, not a cause. As you can see I am angry, sorry. I dieted, went to a    nutritionist, etc.    etc. I continued to gain weight, but there were periods as well that I was hungier, eatting more, eyes bulging, heart palpitations, extreme mood swings and very hyper, not sleeping, but losing eight. I gave in, figured I needed a psychiatrist, went that route, was not it,my eight went to a whopping 378 pounds with extreme rapid gain, I could not take it anymore, I decided to get Baritric surgery. Once again I was prepping for surgery and my thyroid test was bad, indicative of hyperthyroidism.I was informed to go to my PCP, I did, once again another doctor said no way    I should be skinny therefore it is not right. I went ahead with the surgery and have since lost 110 pounds and am 20,000.00 poorer. I had several more lab tests done since and thyroid got worse after each time.I am now going to another doctor an Endocrimologist, they think I have and am going between hypo and hyper.My brain functions is not what it was, no memory, cannot comprehend alot, cannot focus, first half of day I am hyper(NO CAFFEINE), then at about 1:20 I start to crash. I am actually exhausted and hyper at same time. I have headaches which I have never had before,pain in right eye, bulging eyes, weakness.I went to a Carddiologist to rule out my heart, it is all great.I am told and read that undiagnosed and untreated hyperthyroidism can lead    to calcium depletion(Osteoporosis) quickly and am frustrated and concerned with what the overlooking of this condition has caused my body and overall health. Is it possible to have both hyper and hypo at same time, and how can a person be heavy and hyper? Also, I    read that rapid weight loss can cause an increase in    Amiodarone, which can cause hyperthyroidism, is this so?Also I have googled and researched Bariatric surgery and hyperthyroidism and found that many people have been diagnosed post op with hyperthyroidism. Is there a    direct or indirect correlation between the two?

DEMO	Want some opinions on this	"What would you do?Took my 4 yo in yesterday to get immunizations.    She had her health check in August but at the time they did not have all the imm. necessary so If I remember correctly I opted to wait until they had them all before getting any done.    We get there yesterday and the doctor gives her 5 shots, including the flu shot.    Then as I'm checking out, the lady at the front desk says she didn't need all those shots, she only need the flu and one immun.    So I ask the doctor who says he ""didn't see where she had them back in august""    I don't remember her getting ANY shots back in august, but they had them listed in her shot record as having had them...then they gave them to her again yesterday. So, either they aren't keeping records right or they just double dosed her.I started checking on this Doc and the Georgia Medical Board has no record of him.    But I can only find his first initial and last name.    The office won't give me his full first name.    The practice is listed under another doctor, who IS licensed.    But it seems this particular one is not.    Though he is passing himself off as an MD.I plan to obtain copies of my kids records from their office then file a complaint against him.    Any one else ever been through something like this?"
FAML	Sexually Aggressive Child	I need some help on this one and any advice that I can get. I have a 14 year old son who has touched other children that are younger than he is. I am a single mother and rasing both my children on my own with some help from my mom while I am at work. I found out when he was 12 that he touched my cousins little girl I put him into therapy. Then just last year he touched my best friends little girl. And just today I have learned that he has had oral sex with my younger nephew. When I found this out I slapped him across the face. (which made me feel like ****) but it was a reaction from me. He acts like its really no big deal and I don't know how to make him understand that it is a big deal.And yes I found out that he touched my daughter and I went crazy. This is very hard for me. I have talked to my mom about this I told her that I wanted him out of my house. But it is very hard because he is my son. I am not sure as to what to do about all of this. He told me that he thought that he was bi-sexual. I don't care about that I just want him to stop doing what he is doing. I don't understand why he is doing this. I have tried not to leave him alone with younger children but it seems to still happen. He is really not a bad kid except for this. I love him dearly and its killing me inside. There is no one that I can turn to about all of this.    I have researched on the net and I am going to talk to his dr.(therapist) first thing monday morning. But if there is any advice from anyone please give it.

PREG	Strong-Willed Child's Resistance to Potty Training	I have been potty-training my son for the past 8 months, since right before he turned 3.    I put him right into underwear and right on the real toilet.    He was into it at first, especially as I started with small candy rewards.    Soon the rewards started to wear off and he would only go on the potty when he felt like getting a treat.    He tells me he doesn't have to or he'll make me chase him around the house to get him on the potty when I clearly know he has to go.    He is actually great with pooping.    He will go without prompting on the potty, which is awesome.    However, he has pee accidents all the time.    I have tried everything...stickers, charts, praise, toys, special outings, no response, yelling, taking stuff away, using a timer, not asking him and just taking him, etc.    The problem is, he doesn't care if he has an accident and he doesn't care if he sits in wet underwear and pants.    The strategy as of late has been me just taking him at timed intervals, which sort of works, but to me, isn't really potty-trained since he won't go unless I make him.    I just want him to go when he has to...I just don't know what to do and am at my wit's end.    Please help!!

TRMT	Adrenal Fatigue - Cured?	I developed adrenal fatigue as a result of using the inhaled steroid, Advair. I quit the steroid exactly one year ago and began treatment.

PREG	Loestrin and B12- OK or NO?	I have been taking loestrin 24 for about 7 months now. Before then I was taking sprintec. When on sprintec I was moody, overly emotional and reacted to things in a very dramatic way- cried ALL the time. Then I switched to loestrin. I became less emotional but still emotional and started to gain rapid weight (20lbs in the past 7 months). My doctor orriginally said B12 supplements would help my emotions BUT its not. I still cry. It seems I am only emotional an hour after I take my pill (at night) and something happens that I just dont agree with... I want to take B12 shots to see if that would be better. Is it OK to take B12 with Loestrin. I am going to my Dr on Monday but I felt I wanted to know so that my hopes can either be up or down lol. Thanks.
TRMT	6 weeks post surgery	"I see my gynecologist this Thursday for my 6 week post op check up.    What should I expect with that visit?    Better yet, what should I expect, you know, life post hysterectomy?I had a unilateral oophorectomy last December.    No problem.    I hadn't had a period from the month prior to that surgery through the following month.    February's period was one that I hardly knew I was having one.March through June, my periods were beyond out of control.    Heavy bleeding, major cramps.    The cramps were bad enough that I was lying on my bed curled up in a fetal position.    In June, my gyn put me on Provera, which did very little for me.    Slightly less bleeding.In July, I went back to the gyn.    He told me that under no circumstance would he accept any argument about my having a LAVH.    I had that done September 8th.    I was ""introduced"" to HRT that same evening after my surgery.I'm currently using a estrogen transdermal patch.    I'm finding that only 1 out of a package of 4 actually stick to my skin.    No, I'm not doing anything different with the other 3.    It's frustrating!    Although, I do have to admit that the hot flash thing isn't as bad as it was about 4 weeks ago.    I guess that's something to get excited about!    *smile*I've been having some slight discomfort around my belly button, in the area (both sides) of where my mons pubis attaches to my groin.    Has anyone else had this kind of discomfort?    Or am I just going coo coo?I know this is long winded.    I just have so many questions about the hysterectomy and the surgery induced menopause thing.    I don't know what to really expect."
DISE	Cerebrovascular Anomaly	Could the finding of a Cerebrovascular anomaly in the left posterior cerebral artery of suspected congenital origin cause me problems later in life?    I have had several CT scans before and none mentioned this until now and it is supposed to be from infancy.    I don't understand.    If it was missed all this time (I am 50), could it be part of the reason I am having severe dizzy spells (I have had them on and off throughout my life), nausea, shortness of breath and severe short term memory loss?    Could it put me at higher risk of aneurysm or stroke or is this something that is just there and will never cause a problem?

DEMO	how long does it take to clear up yeast infection?	Hi all, I was wondering if you could help me! I had UTI not long ago and I started to take anbiotics for it.

SOCL	Vaginal discharge.	I noticed the same day I shaved, after sex my vaginal area was very sore. After inspecting myself i found two little cuts one on both sides of my vagina. I figured it was only from shaving. While showering when I went to wash it, it seemed as though it was swollen and raw because it sort of burned when the soap hit it and that never happens. When I pee it burns the little cut but then I also noticed some vaginal discharge that didnt look quite normal. It's white and at first it's like thick but liquid like and then it gets clumpy and thick, it doesn't really have an odor but I am pretty concerned about this.
PREG	Progesterone supplements and ovulation	I do not have periods and recent hormone tests show I have low progesterone (0.5) levels. All other hormone levels are good and ovaries look good. My doctor gave me 200 mg of natural progesterone pills that my doctor compounded for me to take once a day. She said to take them for three weeks and then go off for one week and to continue this for at least 3 months. Will this process cause me to ovulate since it will be regulating my progesterone? Do I need to worry about pregnancy? My doctor said I definitely be using some form of birth control but everything I read says that progesterone supplements will stop ovulation. I should also add that I would like to get pregnant soon :-) Thanks for any replies!

GOAL	Depression/ motivation and health	Hi.    I have issues with mood (which I am trying to access support for).    Earlier this year I was training regularly to run a half marathon.    I was doing well until several weeks before the event I sustained several blisters.Since I have done no exercise and have eaten excessively.My goal was to complete a triathlon next year.What can I do to help me get from where I am now to achieving my goal next year?Basically I feel stuck and psychotherapy would help that a great deal but accessing that is an ongoing process.My blisters have healed.    I had a calf strain soon after stopping but that too has healed.Aside from the biomechanical stuff and the psych stuff what could I be doing to help my chances of succeeding next year?While the sports goal is important making long-term lifestyle changes is also a priority.(Stress management, weight loss and maintenance, regular physical activity, etc).I have a basic sports background but just can't seem to translate my goals into action.    (Can't stop eating, can't start exercising.    It's driving me nuts.)Any feedback would be greatly appreciated.

I'm already starting to freak out a little bit, my body hurts, and I'm super 'touchy'.

SOCL	Immigration and Welfare	Immigration and Welfare/Found on the federation for american immigration websiteAlthough the United StatesÃ¢ € ™ welfare rolls are already swollen, every year we import more people who wind up on public assistance: immigrants. Many immigrants are poor; indeed, that is why they come here. The immigrants we admit are much poorer than the native population and are increasing the size of our impoverished population. As a result, the share of immigrant households below the poverty line (18 percent) is much higher than the share of native households that are poor (11 percent)Ã¢ € ”nearly twice as high. And immigrant households are more likely to participate in practically every one of the major means-tested programs. Immigrant use of welfare programs (21 percent) is 43 percent higher than non-immigrantsÃ¢ € ™ use (15 percent).1Each year, state governments spend an estimated $11 billion to $22 billion to provide welfare to immigrants.2Why Are Immigrants On Welfare?Some people mistakenly think that immigrants are not eligible for welfare. Several years ago, Congress did attempt to render immigrants ineligible for most forms of welfare. However, subsequent backpedaling by Congress and the executive branch has undone most of those reforms. Furthermore, many immigrant families get welfare through the eligibility of their U.S. citizen children. (It is also important to realize that even when immigrants are ineligible for federal welfare programs, the burden of their support is simply shifted over to the state and local welfare agencies.)Refugees, asylees, and all amnestied illegal aliens are exempt from the public charge requirement.3 Congress has decided that the American people will serve as the sponsors for these immigrants and pick up the tab for their support.All other immigrants must pass a public charge test and have a U.S. sponsor or sponsors willing to pledge their income to support them. Before a potential immigrant receives an immigration visa, American consular officers are supposed to evaluate whether he or she is likely to become a public charge, and, if so, to deny the visa. The consular officer is supposed to take into account a variety of factors: the amount of support the sponsor can give, the resources and skills of the applicant, and any special conditions (such as age or infirmity) that might affect the applicantÃ¢ € ™s need for support. The Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 set the new legal standard for the evaluation: the sponsor of the applicant must have an annual income of at least 125 percent of the federally designated poverty level. There are several problems with this standard:* The sponsorship income level, only 25 percent higher than the poverty level, is so low that it does not prevent immigrants from going on welfare; in fact, it almost guarantees it. Say a sponsor begins with an income of 200 percent of poverty level and is, therefore, not considered Ã¢ € œlegally poor.Ã¢ €  But after splitting that income with the immigrant, each will be at 100 percent of the poverty level. Where before we had one non-poor person, now we have two poor people. Since eligibility for some welfare programs kicks in before oneÃ¢ € ™s income drops to 125 percent of poverty level, immigrants can easily wind up on welfare.* While immigrants who receive welfare can be deported for violating the conditions under which they were admitted, this provision is rarely enforced; in fact, only twelve people have been deported under this provision since 1980.4 Administrative rulings have held that an immigrant cannot be held responsible for receiving welfare unless the welfare agencies have sent the immigrant a bill for their services, demanded payment, and been refused payment.5 Since welfare agencies do not do this, it is virtually impossible for an immigrant to be charged with violating the public charge provisions that can lead to deportation.* Furthermore, numerous forms of welfare are not considered under the public charge test, including food stamps, pre-natal care, nutrition programs, housing assistance, energy assistance, job training programs, child care services, free or reduced school lunch, public shelters, health clinics, Medicaid, and any cash welfare programs that are not the familyÃ¢ € ™s sole source of income.6 This insulates immigrants from being considered public charges unless they are completely dependent on welfare.What Types of Welfare Are Immigrants Eligible For?As of the 1996 welfare reform bill, the following applies to eligibility for federal and state funded welfare programs:* Legal immigrants are barred from all federal means-tested public benefits for five years after entering the country and barred from SSI and food stamps until citizenship. They are also barred from all federal means-tested public benefits for five years.7* Benefits available to immigrants include school lunch and breakfast programs, immunizations, emergency medical services, disaster relief, and others programs that are necessary to protect life and safety as identified by the attorney general, regardless of immigration status.8* Illegal immigrants are barred from the following federal public benefits: grants, contracts, loans, licenses, retirement, welfare, health, disability, public or assisted housing, post secondary education, food assistance, and unemployment benefits. States are barred from providing state or locally funded benefits to illegal immigrants unless a state law is enacted granting such authority.9Welfare Reform Failed to Solve the ProblemDespite expectations that the 1996 welfare reform bill would cause significant changes in immigrant welfare use, it has actually remained at the same level. The 1996 welfare reforms failed because while the legislation cut immigrants off from certain welfare programs, the savings that resulted from those cuts were not high enough to offset the increased usage of the remaining programs, due to the continuing high number of immigrants entering the U.S. every year.While both Temporary Aid to Needy Families (TANF) and food stamp use have declined by four percent, the decline did not result in any significant savings, as those costs were offset by increases in Medicaid use, which has increased among immigrant households. The total combined value of benefits and payments received by immigrant households from welfare programs remained almost the same, averaging almost $2,000 in 2001, about 50 percent higher than natives. Such high rates of immigrant welfare use, combined with the rapidly increasing immigrant population, has resulted in a four percent increase in the number of immigrant households on welfare, from 14 percent in 1996 to 18 percent in 2000.10Outlook for the FutureThe highest welfare use rates for immigrants are in New York (30 percent), California (28 percent), Massachusetts (25 percent), and Texas (25 percent).12Immigrants are eleven percent of our population, but they are 20 percent of the poor population. Unless our immigration policies are reevaluated and changed accordingly, welfare usage and subsequent costs will remain high.Instead of addressing the problem, some in Congress have suggested measures that would make it even worse, such as proposals to increase immigrantsÃ¢ € ™ eligibility for benefits. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that making legal immigrants eligible for Medicaid and the State ChildrenÃ¢ € ™s Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) would cost an estimated $2.24 billion over ten years.11If we are to have any hope of reducing poverty in the U.S., our immigration laws must be revised and returned to the sensible practice of excluding aliens who are likely to become public charges and to deport those who do.

SOCL	My friend is in love with someone shes never met!	"I have this friend, I've known her for years (we go back til our HS days) I just dont know what to tell her anymore. Not to be mean but I have my fair share of bf problems as it is to be hearing about hers. Here's the thing....years back, and I'm talking about almost 5 years ago. She was up late one night BORED as she claimed and entered a chat group on Y! began chatting with this guy 1:1 afterwords. They started chatting more and more frequently til shortly after became a couple. Now, shes never met the guy & its been almost 5 years. They say ILY and all over the phone and I still dont understand how you can tell someone something like ILY when you have never met them personally. Shes only known the guy by online (chat, myspace etc) and phone. To me the guy seems a ""fake"" just trying to see what girls he can get online because hes not willing to come visit her. He lives in Virginia, we are in CA. & he always seems to have excuses of why he cant come. If you ""love"" her as he claims he does, he would try to come visit her especially after so many yrs.One night she got ""bored"" again and found that her bf had another myspace account which she was not aware of. His top friend, GF #2!    She made a fake profile and sent him a request. Shortly to find that there was pix of him and this other gf kissing. The 2nd gf had a pix of him and her kissing on her page & status was in a relationship. She swore over and over she would break up with him. Even came to my house crying (we live a street away) I stood with her like 6 hours comforting her and talking. Only to know that she decided to forgive him. Fine, forgive and move on right? Well I told her how can you trust someone whos so far away and had already cheated on you!? You dont know if he will do it again and again. Again, she broke into his Y! email account and found several emails from girls asking if he was single. All replies back to the girls were ""YES"" Once again, here we go again. She began swearing she was done! But once again forgave him. I for myself speak and admit that I have in the past cheated on my bf 3xs. & all 3 x's he forgave me. So I understand what it is to forgive and so on. But with a guy she's never met?She has not had a job for YEARS! I've even told her, I think the reason you dont get UP and get a job is because your only source of communication with this guy is phone. She gets so upset when she misses a call. This woman does not leave the house just to be waiting for his calls. I dont know what to tell her anymore. I am tired of hearing Chris this and that! Its frustrating because I've told her as much as I can but she keeps staying with this guy whos shes never met and she swears its love.Any ideas on what I can tell her? I'm dry!"
TRMT	Late Symptoms	I had a hysterctomy (uterus and ovaries) about 10 weeks ago.    For the first 7 weeks I felt great.    When I returned to work three weeks ago, I started staying tired, even on weekends, everything started hurting, I spent last Thurs. with a pillow over my head because of a headache, and my heart started pounding.    According to my doctor, I'm fine; I should have had the symptoms weeks ago, but they're normal.    I trust my doctor, but I really don't feel fine.    I've tried working on hobbies and stuff, hoping it would make me feel better, but it just doesn't. I'm so tired that all I want to do is lay down.    Is there anything I can do to keep going until this passes?    I'd like to still have a job when it's over.
PREG	post partum pancreatitis?	I just gave birth to my second child 2 months ago (my first is 14 months) and I have been diagnosed with thyroiditis (they think it is post partum thyroiditis I am going for testing) and I also had a pancreatitis attack shortly after giving birth to my son a year ago, and one after the birth of my daughter a few weeks ago. Could the pancreatitis be post partum also? I dont drink a ton.

DISE	UPJ obstruction in infant	Dear All,My child, 19 months old, is diagnosed having hydronephrosis.Chronology: The 1st time found during prenancy 6 mth by USG screening but it's considered mild & expected to be able to improve by himself. When he was born on August, 2006, our dr saw no problem at that time.He then developed fever on Dec 17, up    to 39C. Our dr was suspected caused by UTI, proved by Lab test that the number of E.Coli bacteria was 10^5. He was fine after taking antibiotic (Madlexin). Then we when through another USS on Dec 23 and the result is mild bilateral hydronephosis, grade 1&2. He has been 4 times checked by USS. First time at 4months of age which left kidney showed hydronephrosis 11.7mm, at 7 months 9.5mm, at 1 year 9.3mm, at 15 months 9.8 mm, at 19 month 12mm. The right kidney was improving, at 4 months, it showed hydronephrosis 9.2mm, at 7 mth 5mm, at 1 yr 2.3mm, our USS dr said it is normal now. MCU has been done at 5 mths of age showed no VU reflux bilateral, no posterior uretheral valve. MAG 3 has been carried out 3 month ago and showed UPJ obstuction on the left kidney. Based on Mag-3 scan result, the dr    recommends the baby to go to UPJ blockage surgery (Pyeloplasty). For the moment, the baby is taking antibiotic, amoxicillin.to prevent any infection.We are really not keen to let the baby go for surgery and we would like to seek advice/opinionwhether there is any other option we can pursue.Many Thanks before.

DISE	unknown pain	Have had pain for about seven years now and has resulted in loss of my job. Its in the lower right side of abdomen, extemely severe at times. It is a constant pain never gone. Mostly after being on my feet for a short period it starts to worsen. In the sitting position its mild and at times I get these lighting bolts of pain that shoot to the vagina area or lower right back some times down my right leg. Have had several tests, blood, xrays, ultrasounds, cts with and without contrast all neg.or normal so they say its my weight. I have lost 78 lbs. and still no change. I can walk for about half an hour before it starts up then the burning starts up it can get extreme to where I'm doubling over. When it gets that bad its takes forever to stop, I have to lie flat on my back or flat on my stomach to relieve any of the pain. It is a constant pain, it just depends what I do to how bad it worsens. Not much will take it away. All pain meds that I have been put on subsides it alittle but never goes away totally. The only time time in the past seven or so years it was gone was last fall when they did the CT and gave me dipprovan(I think) in the ER. It wewnt away for four hours then back. I am at my wits end can't take much more. I have also had appendix out after rupturing four plus times and lots of adhisions and one C-section in 1990 and the Dr. then removed built up scar tissue from the appendix surgery in late 70's.This discussion is related toright side abdominal pain and gastrointestinal symptoms.
TRMT	Lap Band vs Gastric Bypass	I am considering having weight loss surgery and have been researching both the Lap Band procedure and open gastric bypass.

TRMT	ridding Juvederm lumps 9 months later?	I had Juvederm injections done under my eyes and in my laugh lines 9 months ago.    The filler under my eye were too swollen and the doctor removed some of it but she did an uneven job and 9 months later, I still have lumps under my eyes and lumpiness under my laugh lines.    Can Hyaluroidase still dissolve the product 9 months later?     Will Hyaluroidase    melt away natural fat/tissue or just the product? Also, some days the swelling/lumps are much more dramatic than other days.    Do you know what could be causing that?

His dad is a deadbeat and walked out on me while I was 5 months pregnant.Academically my son has been a great kid in school and no problems what so ever.    Since his sister's been born I've been very easy on him, knowing it's going to take some getting use to her being around and more attention on her.    He does see how involved her father is in her life and he's been asking about his dad.    His dad has called him mayble six times in his life.    I've reached out to him repeatedly, but unfortunately he doesn't care.I've recently started receiving notes from school.    His teacher says he doesn't pay attention in class, acting silly and disrupting others when he should be working.

During class time he will sit there and not do what he needs to do, but does what he want to do.Any advice you can provide will be greatly appreciated!!Thank you!Concern mother

FAML	5 month old premature infant bottle feeding issues	My daughters were born at 33 weeks, stayed in the hospital for only 12 days.    One had a birth mark that grew very fast and we had a steroid injection given so that the growth would stop.    Three weeks after the steroid injection, she quit eating normally.    She went from eating 4 ounces every 3 hours to barely an ounce every three hours.    Now she will not eat when she is awake, only when she is sleeping and not thinking about it but at that, she stops eating after 2 ounces per feeding.    She is now five months old and only 12.6 pounds.    Her twin is eating normally and 16.8 pounds.    She is on Prevacid for reflux but that does not help us with her not eating while she is awake.    She just plays with the nipple and spits the formula back out.    Can you help us?    She has only gained a pound in three months!This discussion is related toinfant feeding problem.

PREG	mood swings	"my 4 year old daughter exhibits strong emotional mood swings. She has fantastic moments in which she is polite, attentive and considerate. The other side of those are emotional outburts (meltdowns) usually triggered by a request from either parent or an argument over ""what's mine"" with her younger sister. Generally, she is very bright and seems to pick up quickly to new challanges. What scares us as parents are the depth and frequency of the outbursts in addition to how very sensitive she is to everything around her, good and bad.    Should we be seeking outside advice to help us deal with these issues? What can we do as parents to help identify the root of the problem?"

FAML	7 yr old girl who is withholding her stools and stains her underwear	My daughter who has been staining her underwear with poop has been doing this since before she started kindergarten.    First I thought it was constipation so the dr put her on miralax and all that was doing was making her go in her pants more.    I took her to a gastro dr and she told me to put her on ex-lax everyday and that wasn't making her poop.    It takes her about 9 days to do an actual stool which sometimes is enormous.    We try taking things away from her and she says for how long and then goes to the bathroom and then poops after I take stuff away thinking ok I pooped now I can get my stuff back.    I don't know what else to do at this point.    It is going to be very embarrasing when she starts first grade and kids then will make fun of her.    This is so frustrating.    Any help would be appreciated.
SOCL	Team Romney, RNC announce raising nearly $77 million in May	"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/06/07/12105658-team-romney-rnc-announce-raising-nearly-77-million-in-may?liteJust hours after the Obama campaign announced that it, the Democratic National Committee, and other Obama-related committees had raked in $60 million in May, Team Romney said they one-upped them.Their Romney campaign/Republican National Committee haul: $76.8 million. They also reported having a combined $107 million in the bank for all of their committees.Ã¢ € œWe are encouraged by the financial support from a broad range of voters,"" Romney Victory National Finance Chairman Spencer Zwick said in a statement. ""Voters are making an investment because they believe that it will benefit the country.Ã¢ € But if the financial reports from April are any indication, much of that nearly $77 million is coming in the form of big five-figure checks from large donors.Around this same time last month, the Romney camp and RNC reported raising a combined $40 million. But when we saw the actual Federal Election Committee filings, it was $11.7 million for the campaign, $11.4 million for the RNC, and the rest -- $17 million -- for the Romney Victory Fund.The Romney Victory Fund -- which also includes coordination with the state GOPs of ID, MA, OK, and VT -- is the mechanism that allows donors to contribute up to $75,000 each. In mid-May, both Mitt Romney and his wife each contributed $75,000 to the Victory Fund.There is also an Obama Victory Fund, which allows large donors to cut equally big checks. But when Team Obama announced raising $43.6 in April, the FEC filings later showed that the campaign raised $25.7 million, the DNC raised $14.3 million, although nearly half of that DNC money came from a transfer from the Obama Victory Fund.(When Team Obama collects large checks, the first $5,000 go to the campaign, which is the individual maximum; $30,800 go to the DNC, which is the max; and the rest go to the other committees.)We will not be able to get a campaign vs. campaign or party vs. party comparison on these numbers until June 20, when FEC reports for May are due"

TRMT	For all Banana Lovers, very interesting.	Just received this in my e-mail, wanted to share.BANANAS TO YOU FRIEND,A professor at CCNY for a physiological psych class told his class about bananas.. He said the expression 'going bananas' is from the effects of bananas on the brain. Read on:After reading this, you'll never look at a banana in the same way again.Bananas contain three natural sugars - sucrose, fructose and glucose combined with fiber. A banana gives an instant, sustained and substantial boost of energy.Research has proven that just two bananas provide enough energy for a strenuous 90-minute workout. No wonder the banana is the number one fruit with the world's leading athletes.But energy isn't the only way a banana can help us keep fit. It can also help overcome or prevent a substantial number of illnesses and conditions, making it a must to add to our daily diet.Depression:According to a recent survey undertaken by MIND amongst people suffering from depression, many felt much better after eating a banana. This is because bananas contain tryptophan, a type of protein that the body converts into serotonin, known to make you relax, improve your mood and generally make you feel happier.PMS:Forget the pills - eat a banana. The vitamin B6 it contains regulates blood glucose levels, which can affect your mood.Anemia:High in iron, bananas can stimulate the production of hemoglobin in the blood and so helps in cases of anemia.Blood Pressure:This unique tropical fruit is extremely high in potassium yet low in salt, making it perfect to beat blood pressure. So much so, the US Food and Drug Administration has just allowed the banana industry to make official claims for the fruit's ability to reduce the risk of blood pressure and stroke.Brain Power:200 students at a Twickenham (Middlesex) school were helped through their exams this year by eating bananas at breakfast, break, and lunch in a bid to boost their brain power. Research has shown that the potassium-packed fruit can assist learning by making pupils more alert.Constipation:High in fiber, including bananas in the diet can help restore normal bowel action, helping to overcome the problem without resorting to laxatives.Hangovers:One of the quickest ways of curing a hangover is to make a banana milkshake, sweetened with honey. The banana calms the stomach and, with the help of the honey, builds up depleted blood sugar levels, while the milk soothes and re-hydrates your system.Heartburn:Bananas have a natural antacid effect in the body, so if you suffer from heartburn, try eating a banana for soothing relief.Morning Sickness:Snacking on bananas between meals helps to keep blood sugar levels up and avoid morning sickness.Mosquito bites:Before reaching for the insect bite cream, try rubbing the affected area with the inside of a banana skin. Many people find it amazingly successful at reducing swelling and irritation.Nerves:Bananas are high in B vitamins that help calm the nervous system.Overweightand at work? Studies at the Institute of Psychology in Austria found pressure at work leads to gorging on comfort food like chocolate and crisps. Looking at 5,000 hospital patients, researchers found the most obese were more likely to be in high-pressure jobs. The report concluded that, to avoid panic-induced food cravings, we need to control our blood sugar levels by snacking on high carbohydrate foods every two hours to keep levels steady.Ulcers:The banana is used as the dietary food against intestinal disorders because of its soft texture and smoothness. It is the only raw fruit that can be eaten without distress in over-chronicler cases. It also neutralizes over-acidity and reduces irritation by coating the lining of the stomach.Temperature control:Many other cultures see bananas as a 'cooling' fruit that can lower both the physical and em otional temperature of expectant mothers. In Thailand , for example, pregnant women eat bananas to ensure their baby is born with a cool temperature.Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD): Bananas can help SAD sufferers because they contain the natural mood enhancer tryptophan.Smoking &Tobacco Use:Bananas can also help people trying to give up smoking. The B6, B12 they contain, as well as the potassium and magnesium found in them, help the body recover from the effects of nicotine withdrawal.Stress:Potassium is a vital mineral, which helps normalize the heartbeat, sends oxygen to the brain and regulates your body's water balance. When we are stressed, our metabolic rate rises, thereby reducing our potassium levels. These can be rebalanced with the help of a high-potassium banana snack.Strokes:According to research in The New England Journal of Medicine, eating bananas as part of a regular diet can cut the risk of death by strokes by as much as 40%!Warts:Those keen on natural alternatives swear that if you want to kill off a wart, take a piece of banana skin and place it on the wart, with the yellow side out. Carefully hold the skin in place with a plaster or surgical tape!So, a banana really is a natural remedy for many ills. When you compare it to an apple, it has four times the protein, twice the carbohydrate, three times the phosphorus, five times the vitamin A and iron, and twice the other vitamins and minerals. It is also rich in potassium and is one of the best val ue foods around So maybe its time to change that well-known phrase so that we say, 'A banana a day keeps the doctor away!'PASS IT ON TO YOUR FRIENDSPS: Bananas must be the reason monkeys are so happy all the time! I will add one here; want a quick shine on our shoes?? Take the INSIDE of the banana skin, and rub directly on the shoe...polish with dry cloth. Amazing fruit !

PREG	Another FAQ, Slow down in movement?	I know this gets asked a ton on here, but I was wondering when you noticed a slow down in movement? I am 36 1/2 weeks, and have noticed a steady drop in sharp movement, though she is still moving. I was panicking last night, because she does not move much at all at night when I am asleep, and It took me several minutes to rouse her after I came back from the bathroom.(laid on one side, then moved to the other, then sat up, rubbed and talked to my belly...that finally worked, 10 minutes later) She remains fairly active during the day, but the movements are a lot slower and not all over the place. I wonder how much a baby should be moving at this point. I keep asking my midwife, and she just says, ''as long as she is moving...'' I just wonder how I would know if my baby was in distress....
SOCL	Postal Service looks to end at-your-door mail	"If you're moving to a newly built house, say goodbye to mail delivery at your door.And if some House Republicans get their way, all door-to-door mail delivery will go away.The U.S. Postal Service is marching towards a more ""centralized delivery,"" where residents pick up their own mail from clusters of mail boxes located in their neighborhood. Local postmasters are sending hundreds of letters to fast-growing communities, warning that cluster boxes will be the way mail will be delivered to new developments.In the past year, the cash-strapped Postal Service has been asking companies in industrial parks and shopping malls to also adopt this form of mail delivery.But Rep. Darrell Issa, the California Republican leading the House effort to save the postal service, wants more. He has made doing away with doorstep delivery a key part of his bill, which would require everyone to get mail at a curbside box or from a cluster box.""A balanced approach to saving the Postal Service means allowing USPS to adapt to America's changing use of mail,"" said Issa, who is chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee.Moving away from door-to-door delivery saves a lot of money. Right now, 35 million residences and businesses get mail delivered to their doorstep.It costs $353 per stop for a delivery in most American cities, taking into account such things as salaries and cost of transport. By contrast, curbside mail box delivery costs $224, while cluster boxes cost $160, according to a report from the Postal Service's Office of Inspector General.Delivering mail is the agency's largest fixed cost -- $30 billion. Ending such door deliveries would save $4.5 billion a year. That's more than the $3 billion it would have saved from ending Saturday mail service, according to government reports.Related: Los Angeles is worst for mail carrier dog bitesThat's why ending door delivery has drawn industry support from groups like the Greeting Card Association, which supports Saturday service.But unions say it's a bad idea to end delivery to doorsteps and will be disruptive for the elderly and disabled.""It's madness,"" said Jim Sauber, chief of staff for the National Association of Letter Carriers. ""The idea that somebody is going to walk down to their mailbox in Buffalo, New York, in the winter snow to get their mail is just crazy.""Yet postal officials say everything's on the table, when it comes to cost-cutting. Earlier this year, it tried to end Saturday mail delivery, but later reversed its decision.USPS fails to deliver $5.5 billionUSPS fails to deliver $5.5 billionThe Postal Service continues to struggle with mail volume, especially drops in first-class mail, its big revenue driver, as more Americans move to electronic billing and e-mailing.In 2012, the agency lost $16 billion. Last year, the agency twice defaulted on payments owed to the federal government to prefund retiree health care benefits totaling $11 billion. The agency has also exhausted a $15 billion line of credit from the U.S. Treasury.Ending a Congressional mandate to make large annual payments toward retiree health care benefits would help solve the agency's woes.As it awaits for help from Congress, the postal agency has been trying to do what it can on its own. One of the initiatives is pushing cluster boxes on new developments.""Prior to this spring, we'd work with the construction companies and they could decide if the houses would get cluster boxes or curbline delivery --- now the Postal Service makes that decision,"" said Postal Service spokeswoman Sue Brennan.Related: Wave of federal retirees to hit governmentIn Cranberry, Pa., the community is up in arms after getting a letter in April from the Postal Service saying cluster boxes would be going in new developments.Community leaders say they understand the boxes are cheaper but they want a better plan that takes into account safety, access and maintenance. Township leaders and the postal service are holding talks over the boxes.""We understand what's driving this is a cost savings,"" said Cranberry Township Manager Jerry Andree. ""But you can't just take a cluster box and drop it into the community without planning for its safety, use and access.""For now, residents already receiving door delivery will see no change, unless the route is deemed dangerous because a dog bites a mailman or Congress changes the law, said Steven Hutkins, a professor of literature at New York University, and a postal service expert.""The big thing will be if they get approval in legislation to make the switch for existing door delivery customers,"" said Hutkins, who writes the blog Save the Post Office.http://money.cnn.com/2013/07/23/news/economy/postal-home-delivery/index.html?iid=H_E_News"

GOAL	Lower Back Pain	Help me please!    I'm a 44 year old woman.    Every morning I get up and walk around like a 90 year old because my lower back is killing me!    Takes about an hour or so to calm down.    I have to sit up straight until the pain subsides- walking around makes it worse.    It feels as though I have one leg shorter than the other - like I'm lop sided when I have this pain.    I'm a tennis players but for the past 6 months I've had to cancel all morning tennis.    Last weekend I tried to play tennis in the morning but ended up on the bench in tears with pain and frustration.I've tried different mattresses, sleeping with a pillow between my legs, sleeping on my side etc.    I try and exercise my back when I can - stretch etc.    I've even been to a couple of chiropractors.    It only hurts in the morning when I wake up.    I try not to take pain killers but I'm running out of ideas.What should I do?

GOAL	Bruised chest	"Well to start the story I am underweight due to my being sick with a mixture of IBS and anxiety the past three years. So I am 19 years old and 6' 4"" 142 lbs. No pec muscles do to my anxiety keeping me from going out of the house the past few years. I'm allergic to milk so I don't get the calcium I should. Now we found my dog dead this morning and when I saw my brother I blamed him for letting him out to get hit by a car. And when i did he pushed me down and I got up in a rage and went to punch him. My dad pulled us apart and some where in the shuffle I got punched square in the chest/sternum on the left side and since my chest has been hurting. When I rub a certain location I cause more pain that feels like a bruise right in between two ribs. I took an Advil and it hasn't really touched the pain. Should I be worried? Is it safe to try to sleep?"

FAML	7  yo wants to die!	My 7 year old daughter is either good as gold or her evil twin.    She can be the sweetest thing on earth.    Helping everyone.    Concerned and very caring.    The next minute I swear she turns into the evil child. During these moments she is belligerent and extremely rude to me,    her mom. She will scream at the top of her lungs when she does not get her own way.    She will say some very hurtful things at me during these times,.    ex: you don't love me and you love Alex (her brother ) way more. Sometimes I just want to die.    I'll kill myself, I want to kill myself. This whole family hates me.    No body listens to me.    You all want me gone and then on and on about wanting to be dead and wanting to just die.At first I didn't worry to much and thought it would pass but it is not going away. (1 year later). I feel she truly believes that I love her brother more and is she thinks she wants to die at that very moment.    Now I do not love her brother more and am very careful to share equal emotion and time with both. Her brother is 2 years older than her.    My question to you is how to deal with the situation when it arises.    She is very out of control at these times and hard to get close to.     I don't know what to do anymore.     Is there someway for me to try and help her out. Or should I get her in to see a counselor.Please can you give me any suggestions.     Her family is in tack and there is no major marital discord in our family.    Just your normal middle class family I guess.Regards, LB

FAML	feces smearing	"My boyfriend lost his spouse almost three years ago when she died of a heart attack after putting her kids to bed.    His 10 yr old son has been to my house several times along with his 8 yr old daughter.    His son on three separate occasions has smeared feces on my furniture and bathroom floor.    I discussed this incident with my boyfriend and he had addressed it with his son.    He apparently does this every so often.    I have had several different talks with my boyfriend about this because this behavior is alarming to me.    I have both a background in early childhood and in the medical field.    I believe this is a ""cry for help"" and that he may be being sexually abused.    I would like some insight to this and how I should handle this.    I am at a loss for words.    I have talked with my boyfriend telling him that he should talk to his pediatrician and he thinks he has just got a nasty habit.    My boyfriend is 15 yrs older and he is a little set in his ways but, I think he is way off.    I am concerned he does not want to address this issue seeing as his son is 10 and not 2 and playing in poop.    I don't want to ruin my relationship with my boyfriend but, it is concerning me that he won't investigate this more.    Am I being paranoid or wrong to think this of his son?    My boyfriend also has mentioned his son he may have a disorder called Hirsprung's disease.    He has had intestinal issues since a little boy.    He has seen specialist for this.    By why would he play in his feces?    Please, please, please give some insight to this.    Thank you for your time.This discussion is related to7 Year Old Boy Playing With Feces In    School Bathroom."

SOCL	bruised rib	This discussion is related tobruised rib?.I recently fell on steps at work and bruised my ribs. At the emergency room they took x-rays and a cat scan just to make sure that I didn't hurt my kidney. I hurt my bottom two ribs on my right side. They told me that their really isn't much they or I could do. They perscribed pain meds and rest. Getting up and down is a real problem. I forgot to ask the doctor if using a heating pad on my ribs is a good idea.
DISE	What can this be?	For the last 5 weeks I have had a redness on the tip of my penis on both sides which seems to get worse if it gets rubbed or after a shower.    about 2 weeks ago near the area I developed small brown marks which look like bruises also on both sides, not too noticeable but they are to me.    I went in for STD testing after the oral sex incident which was right before the redness started showing up and all results came back (-) but HSV wasnt tested.    I went to the doctor this week and had him look at what i am describing and he said it may be from physical activity or such and said he doesnt think it is anything and not to worry.    there was aslo some redness below the redness on the tip leading into the shaft.    I havent had any pain, blisters etc... no burning during urination although a couple weeks ago I amy have felt the urge to urinate more often for some reason.    Any idea on what this could be and why it is lasting so long?    this would now be 1 month and 1 week with symptoms and it is driving me completely crazy and greatly effecting me.

SOCL	America has low taxes Ã¢Â€Â¦so why do people feel ripped off?	Part 1Joshua HollandToday is the 100th anniversary of the federal income tax, which was signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson on October 3, 1913.To mark the occasion, Moyers & Company caught up with David Cay Johnston, who has probably forgotten more about our tax code than most economic experts ever knew. Johnston won a Pulitzer Prize in 2001 for his comprehensive reporting on taxes and tax avoidance in The New York Times, and then authored a best-selling book on the subject, Perfectly Legal: The Covert Campaign to Rig Our Tax System to Benefit the Super-Rich Ã¢ € “ and Cheat Everybody Else.Below is a lightly edited transcript of our discussion.Joshua Holland: When we got into World War II, individuals and families paid 38 percent of federal income taxes and corporations picked up the other 62 percent. Last year, individuals and families paid 82 percent of federal income taxes and corporations paid just 18 percent. How did this happen?David Cay Johnston: All modern societies require a large public sector to provide the goods and services on which the private sector depends. So you need commonwealth services Ã¢ € “ education, basic research, statistical gathering and civil law enforcement Ã¢ € “ a whole host of activity than can only be provided through the public sector.Now, corporations have a concentrated interest in the taxes they pay and the capacity to lobby for changes and make campaign donations to rent, or in some cases buy politiciansÃ¢ € ™ votes. Over a long period of time, they saw to it that we change these tax laws and shifted this burden.We also dramatically increased the size of the federal government during the period from before World War II until now and some of the additional money youÃ¢ € ™re seeing is the result of increased Social Security taxes and Medicare taxes Ã¢ € ” some programs that benefit people generally, and that I think we should look at as efficient buying at the wholesale level, rather than retail.Holland: Unpack that for me, David.Johnston: Sure. Corporations in the days before World War II were essentially domestic operations, with a few exceptions. And we now have a global economy. And in the global economy, corporations all around the world are going to push to get the lowest tax Ã¢ € ” or no tax at all in some places Ã¢ € ” and then use that to pressure the US government to ease their tax burdens.TheyÃ¢ € ™ve also, by the way, put in place innumerable little rules changes involving accounting and depreciation Ã¢ € ” that is writing down the value of equipment as itÃ¢ € ™s being used up Ã¢ € ” and other things, to reduce their bills.Holland: And does this help explain why we have a very low tax burden overall, relative to other wealthy countries, but a lot of Americans feel that theyÃ¢ € ™re being taxed to death?Johnston: Well, one of the reasons some Americans feel theyÃ¢ € ™re being taxed to death is that if you add up our taxes, which are low compared to other modern countries, and then you add in private expenditures for things the tax system pays for in other countries Ã¢ € ” a lot of our health care costs, higher education costs, admissions and fees and tickets and licenses for a lot of things Ã¢ € ” lo and behold, we end up being a relatively high-tax country. But it depends on how you analyze the data.And let me give you one killer figure: We spend so much money on our health care in this country Ã¢ € ” or as I prefer to think of it, sick care in this country Ã¢ € ” that for every dollar that the other 33 modern economies spend for universal coverage, we spend $2.64. And this is done using something called Ã¢ € œpurchasing parity dollars,Ã¢ €  so theyÃ¢ € ™re truly comparable. So we spend $2.64 per person and still have almost 50 million people with no coverage and 30 million with limited coverage, and these other countries spend far less with universal coverage.HereÃ¢ € ™s how much that costs: In the year 2010, if we had had the French health care system, which is one of the most expensive in the world, it would have provided universal coverage and it also would have saved us so much money that we could have eliminated the individual income tax that year and all else would have been equal. Our excess health care costs above those of the French were a little over 6 percent of the economy and the income tax in 2010 brought in about 6 percent of the economy.http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2013/10/04/america-has-low-taxes-so-why-do-people-feel-ripped-off/
TRMT	Treatment for fat necrosis after breast reduction	"Hello,My mother had a breast recution a couple weeks ago.    She had implants removed and went from a DD to a C.    I am not sure how much tissue was removed.    About a week after her surgery, her right nipple turned black and she had an apple size necrotic mass removed.    The biopsy came back that she had a bacterial infection, so the surgeon left the wound open to heal by secondary intent.    We have been taking good care of the dressings and everything seemed to be healing ok, but then her right breast started to get hard.    The surgeon believes the necrosis is spreading and he will have to open the right brest to remove the tissue.My mom has been using heat (one of those microwavable hot/cold packs), and has been using a hand massager to attemt to break up the ""hard"" tissue.At this point we are unsure what to do.    What causes necrosis?    Is this common?She is also complaining about being really tired...could that be related?Should my mother get another opinion?I am open to any thoughts, suggestions, shared experiences...anythiung...Thank you,"

ThatÃ¢ € ™s not according to Rasmussen either; itÃ¢ € ™s from the DemocratsÃ¢ € ™ own surveys. No wonder the White House is looking around for a new villain: If even the Bushitler seems preferable to swing voters, whoÃ¢ € ™s left to demonize?An earnest question for lefties: Given the state of the DemocratsÃ¢ € ™ polling, can we finally dispense with the insane yet oft-repeated argument during the ObamaCare debate that passing the bill was the surest way to mitigate losses in the midterms? There were two political reasons to pass O-Care, as youÃ¢ € ™ll recall: (1) Long-term, passage will set the country irreversibly on the path to socialized medicine, which in turn will create a culture of dependency guaranteeing big Democratic victories far into the future; (2) short-term, passage will cheer liberals and inspire them to turn out in November whereas letting the bill drop will break liberal hearts all over again a la 1993 and will ensure a Republican rout in the midterms. Can we now agree, with the GOP reaching historic leads on the generic ballot, that the second reason has turned out to be a little, well, insane? Or is the new argument that letting the bill drop last year to focus on the economy somehow would have produced an even more gigantic Republican generic ballot lead? No bill = Bushitler outpolling Obama by 10 points instead of six in frontline districts, in other words? Seriously?

PREG	healthy heart - but circulatory issues	Hi there,I have a question about my toddler that has been having blue lips for about 6 months.    She's 19 months old now.A month ago her lips and mouth went blue, then she suddently went unconscious, non-breathing.    She's had blood work, chest x-rays, ECG's and holter heart monitor tests that all came back normal. She saw a pediatric cardiologist who said she has the slightest heart murmer, but the degree of her murmer is so minor there's no way it'd cause her to suddenly go unconscious.Now something else has happend.    She was her normal self and sudenly spaced out completey.    She was staring into space, looking towards the ground with her eyes moving back and forth slightly (like reading a book).    She was not responding to any stimulation (snapping fingers in front of her nose, calling her name, lifting and dropping her arm at her side)    but she finally snapped out of it (about 20 seconds later) when her favorite toy was shaken twice.We have now visited a neurologist who did initial tests and said she's completely normal from what he sees.    We're scheduled to do an EEG in a month but he thinks he won't find anything.He thinks it's a circulatory issue because only parts of her body (lips, hands, fingers) go blue.    He said if there was a lack of oxygen that her whole body would be going blue. He told us she'll likely grow out of it and we should stop putting her throught all these tests.So my question is: If a pediatric cardiologist says her heart is practically perfect, could she still have a circulatory issue?    I mean, if her heart is pumping as it should etc, is it possible to have a circulatory issue, and why?    Where do we go from here?    Any insight on the entire issue would be appreciated.Many thanks.Kelly

FAML	6 year old pooping in pants	My six year old daughter took forever to potty train. She would pee in the potty right from the get go but it took three years to get her to not poop in her pants. It was so so so very frustrating. The all of the sudden when I had my other daughter in January this year she stopped going in her pants. She hadnt since then, but within the last two weeks she started doing it again. Sometimes if she comes home from school with poop in her pants she says its because she doesnt like to wipe with toilet paper. At home she wipes with baby wipes. Sometimes she says she didnt know that she pooped. I dont know if I believe her. Could she really not know if she pooped and then not know that there was poop in her pants when I ask? I dont know why now she is doing it again. Its very frustrating and I have no idea what to do. =( Should I take her to the doctor?? please help =(

Most of the time he does not know what he is talking about. So we tell him ""that's not right"" and he gets so upset and just starts crying. We usually let him check the mail but I had to check is because I was expecting something and he satarted crying and it lasted for an hour because of the mail.

TRMT	Something similar I&#x27;m afraid	A few years ago, I was referred to an Endodontist for possible Root Canal, which she did and decided that although I'd had an infection, that this took care of it.    My Dentist at the time after more x-rays, questioned this but I was not showing any more problems. Recently, I have developed, a sore throat on the right side, my tongue on right side, underneath has an odd blister-like,    swelling and    on the right lower, the Lymph gland is swollen. I am seeing another Dentist, listed under    ORAL & MAXIlFOCIAL Surgery to have #'s 31 & 29 removed ( upper right back ) Friday.    I have had this Lymph swelling neumorus times in the last 10 years, under the care of 3 different dentists.Now, my question, could this cause other, seemingly unrelated symptoms ?     I'm experiencing, a lot of stomach problems, diagnosed 6 yrs ago as IBS but more recently seeming to be worse---- a lot of burning in stomach and abdomen..& pain/aching in my spine.    My system seems to be very acidic and i am tired. I'm already Diabetic and have Fibro so its hard to determine if this infection ( as my Dentist seems to think it is,) is causing these added problems.Has anyone had certin conditions go from bad to worse, due to an infection of this type ?

DISE	Uncomfortable in my stomoch after eating	Hello Doctor, i feel uncomfortable after eating.    And if i eat more food or more oily food, i will uncomfort in my stomoch and as well as right side of stomoch(near the right ribs).    That is not pain, but it is uncomfortable.

I reduce rice intake and taking raw vegetables.    Even still some times uncomfort some times.Can you please tell me the reason!!!Eshaaa.
SOCL	Black, Mormon and female, Utah Republican embodies new hope	"(Reuters) - Rock star. Novelty. Myth-buster. Surprise.That's how some pundits describe Mia Love, a Republican congressional nominee in Utah who is upending stereotypes about the state and its predominant faith. A rising star and mayor of a small Utah city, she will have a brief prime-time speaking role on Tuesday at the Republican convention.Love, 36, is a black Mormon in a deeply conservative state where her race makes up less than 3 percent of the population. If she bests the popular, right-of-center Democratic incumbent, Jim Matheson, in November, Love would be the first black, conservative woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, although polls show she faces an uphill battle.""I believe our country is in big trouble,"" said Love, also a runner who teaches fitness classes. ""If I can make a difference, not only should I do it, it's my obligation as a parent and an American.""In 2010, she was the first black woman elected as mayor of a Utah city. She's also a first-generation U.S. citizen whose parents immigrated to New York from Haiti in the 1970s in search of the American dream and who wanted to make sure their daughter contributed to society.Love, a mother of three, says she's running against six-term incumbent Matheson in the newly created 4th District in central Utah to do just that. Matheson represents Utah's 2nd District and opted to run in the 4th after redistricting scattered his constituents.That Love captured the Republican nomination was a surprise both in and out of Utah. A Tea Party darling, she is now seen as representing the strongest chance in a decade for Republicans to push Matheson, the lone Democrat in Utah's congressional delegation and a fellow Mormon, out of office.'A WILD CARD'Little-known outside of Saratoga Springs, a farming hamlet turned city of 18,000 about 35 miles south of Salt Lake City, Love leap-frogged over a crowded field including two better-known state lawmakers to snag the nomination with over 70 percent of the vote at the state Republican convention in April.Utah political insiders chalked up her victory to a confluence of events, including infighting between two front-runners and an engaging speech by Love that hit all the right notes for the traditionally conservative delegates.She champions limited government, fiscal discipline, personal responsibility and state's rights. She's pro-gun and holds a concealed weapon permit, opposes abortion and has said she would favor dismantling the federal departments of energy and education.She also supports Utah's effort to reclaim public lands from federal agency controls and would vote against regulations she believes would restrict economic development.""She was clearly a wild card,"" Matthew Burbank, a University of Utah political science professor, said. ""She's not all that different in the sense of her political views and her being a member of the majority religion. On the other hand, she does have a life story that is different than anybody I can think of in Utah politics.""Love has the backing of the National Republican Congressional Committee, which has given her campaign nearly $1 million for fall television ads.""I have never had a problem with people calling me a shiny new toy, but hopefully it's what I stand for that matters,"" Love said. ""I was elected as mayor with 60 percent of the vote, and it wasn't because I'm black and I'm female.""Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona and House Speaker John Boehner have campaigned for Love in Utah. Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice is due to appear at a Utah event on September 7.Ann Romney, wife of Republican presidential contender Mitt Romney, has endorsed Love, as has Romney's running mate, Paul Ryan. But national support, or even her speaking role at the Republican convention, may not help Love gain enough ground to win.A recent poll conducted for Salt Lake City media outlets the Deseret News and KSL television found she trailed the race 53 percent to 38 percent.FOCUS ON RACEStill, there's no question that Love's race is part of what's drawing the attention of party leaders, said LaVar Webb, a longtime Salt Lake City-based Republican strategist.""They wouldn't discuss this publicly, but the fact that a black woman could be elected in Utah I think would signal that (the state) is more diverse and open-minded and cosmopolitan than people believe,"" Webb said.Matheson, the son of Utah's last Democratic governor, has held his seat because he's viewed as a moderate who breaks party lines to vote with Republicans on issues that align with Utah's more conservative values, pundits said.Matheson, however, disagreed that Love offers voters anything dramatically different from past challengers.""I don't think most Utahns want to get rid of the Department of Energy or the Department of Education,"" Matheson said earlier this year at a community event. ""It just sounds like more of the same, extreme positions from someone who will go to Washington and vote the party line.""SOURCE: http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/08/28/us-usa-campaign-mormon-idUSBRE87Q19Q20120828"

SOCL	US jobless claims surge more than expected	"WASHINGTON (AFP) Ã¢ € “ New claims for US unemployment benefits jumped more than expected last week, official data showed Thursday on the eve of the key June jobs report.Initial claims for jobless benefits rose to a seasonally adjusted 472,000 in the week ending June 26, an increase of 13,000 from the previous week's upwardly revised level of 459,000, the Labor Department said.The leap was sharply higher than the consensus analyst forecast of 458,000 claims.The four-week moving average, which helps smooth out weekly volatility, rose 0.7 percent to 466,500.""The trend has generally been moving higher in recent weeks, suggesting that the labor market is perhaps starting to weaken,"" said Andrew Gledhill at Moody's Economy.com.In the previous week ending June 19, the insured unemployment rate was 3.6 percent, unchanged from the prior week's revised rate, the department said.The number of people collecting unemployment insurance benefits in the week to June 19 rose by 43,000 to 4,616,000, while the four-week moving average slipped 0.5 percent to 4,567,500.Gledhill called recent moves in claims ""troubling.""""In typical job market recoveries, claims would be much lower -- below 400,000 -- but in the current situation they have remained stubbornly elevated. Part of the explanation is that hiring is very low, potentially prompting a greater share of unemployed than is typical to file for benefits coming out of a recession.""The weekly jobless claims data came on the eve of the department's key June jobs report, widely expected to show worsening conditions.Most analysts expect the data Friday will show the unemployment rate rose to 9.8 percent from 9.7 percent in May, and the economy shed 100,000 nonfarm jobs after adding 431,000 in the prior month, mainly temporary government jobs for the 2010 census."
DEMO	Suddenly I can not empty my bladder	I have COPD. I got a cold and it was on it's way to turning into pneumonia. I went to the doctor. I was given some kind of antibiotic shot in the butt, and then sent home with three doses (days) of Azithromycin (500 mg per dose). I was also put on blood pressure medication for the first time. It is Lisinopril, 10 mg in the morning and evening. Other than this I take Spiriva once a day and use albuterol by nebulizer. I also take many supplements every day.I was fine yesterday after going to the doctor, in fact felt like a new person shortly after and I am assuming this is due to that shot they gave me. I felt great this morning when I went back to the doctor for a short re-check. I have another appointment for next Monday.The problem began after I got home from my appointment, I'd say around 2 p.m. Suddenly I have diarrhea. It's not that I have to run to the bathroom every 15 minutes, but seems to be simply that I had a bowel movement and it was basically brown water. I had a very normal bowel movement last evening. Then I started noticing last evening that when I had to go to the bathroom, not much was coming. And today it's worse. At this point there is no pain, and not even a lot of discomfort. But I do feel I have to go and when I attempt to only a few trickles, or nothing comes.Could this be from that antibiotic shot they gave me, or could it be from the Azithromycin or Lisinopril, or a combination? I'm a bit frightened and not sure what to you. I live in a small rural town with a clinic. The doctor I seen will not be back here now until next Monday.I would appreciate some input on this, please.
GOAL	Vireous detachment-vision	My close up or reading vision has not been very good for some time ( years-) in in the past 2 years    reading glasses and magnifyers had enabled me to do some craft work for short periods of time. I have had a multitude of procedures over the past few years and have become accustomed to and adjusting to low vision.    In any case I have had more retinaplexi for horshoe tears in the retina ( 3 ) this year and the specialist explained that the Vitreaous is pulling away and occasionally causes these tears. I think the doc is getting a bit more concerned lately ( although he tells us its ok ) because he has me on a    2 - 3 month exam schedule now ( went from yearly to 9 to 6 and now every 2-3 months )My question is this-- Lately my reading vision is worse- not a lot but noticeably worse- my distance vision seems to be the same.     I thinjk the doc told us one time that the macula ( had some bouts with Macular swelling and a pucker peel-vitrectomy in the right eye ) effects close up or detail vision but we think he said the vetreous pulling away also effects close up vision in older patients ( I am only 54 but the doc told us one time that my eyes remind him of much older in terms of condtions ) .Before my macular pucker and Vitrectomy    ( rt eye )    that eye was of no help to read ect. and was makeing me sick from all the wavey    images and the procedure has taken care of that 100% and I can almost read the top line of the reading chart with it now .Does the vitreous pulling away effect reading vision??I am constantly getting round dot floaters in my left eye and doc said eventually we may have to do a Vitrectomy on the left eye but doesn't want to until absolutely needed- I asked if it was because of possible side effects and he said no he just feeles it would be better to wait---I do have lens issues ( Occular Rosacea-dry eye-chronic conjuntivitis ) all that flare up and lower reading I know it can come from them but I am treating all those and they have their ups and downs it just seems like the baseline reading vision is consistantly a bit worse and we are trying to decide about calling doc or waiting until June 4 appointment if no further or increased problems . It pretty much sounded to my wife and I that my reading vision would always be a struggle and the low vision aids    are about all I can do right now.I have so many small issues that It becomes a bigger issue overall is how one doc explained it .Does a Vitrectomy slow down or stop Vitreous pulling away ??Why would they want to wait if it doesn't cause side effects??My rt eye isn't real helpful to read but since the PEEL-Vitrectomy- I have had no round dots and havent noticed any floaters since ( 1 1/2 years )ThanksI realize there are so many issues here-purhaps if nothing else you could refresh us on why my reading close up vision gets worse with age- The doc explained    but with all the other stuff we are mixed up .

GOAL	Concerned about lingering infections	I have had an eye infection now for about 3 weeks. It appears to be a small internal stye on my lower eyelid. My eye doc gave me amoxil by mouth and tobramycin drops. It immediately responded and was doing much better until about day 8. I went back to the eye doc and he gave me a z-pak to take orally and changed they eye drops to zymaxid. I am on day 3 of that now and am worried it isnt responding like it should. I still have some pain (which as lessened), but I have had a big bag of fluid under my eyelid. I have been using warm compresses as directed, but yesterday started a few cool ones to try to help reduce the edema in my eyelid.I am woried about MRSA or something more serious than a stye since the eyelid isnt responding to treatment.

DISE	More info on this	"I have been diagnosed with Hep B AB Hep B Core Hep BE. I read that a "" positive test for core antibody in the absence of other antibodies against HBV therefore calls for a test specific to Hepatitis C as well as additional tests for Hepatitis B"".Q: Specific to Hepatitis C? is it to see if I have been a Chronic carrier of Hepatitis C? because I know about 25 to 50 percent of patients with chronic Hepatitis C will have a positive Hepatis B core antibody test.I also read that the HBeAg is an antigen that stimulates an antibody (e antibody) that is diagnostically important because it reflects active replication of the virus. A positive test for the HBe antigen indicates that the virus is continuing to reproduce itself, while presence of the antibody indicates that it is not.Q: By taking medications or maybe the vaccination for Hepatitis B, do you think it can stop the replication of this virus? I am 19 now, is it too late to take the vaccination?How long do I have to take medication for this? lifetime? or only if by miracle it goes away?even if it does go away, do I still have to take medication for that?Is it safe to get married and have kids? Because the doctor told me I could not kiss anyone or even put my toothbrush near anybody else's toothbrush. No, I'm not sexually active, at leat for 2 yrs going on 3 nowIs there a way to find out how I attracted this virus or how long I've had it?"
TRMT	Just started clomid 5/7/12	I started my first round of clomid today. The doctor said since I had not had any periods for a while, that I could start taking the clomid right away.

FAML	2 Year old suddenly doesn't sleep	My 2 year old Daughter was a great sleeper (13 hrs/night with a 2-3 hour nap)    She always slept in her own crib, in her own room.    I put her down, said goodnight and she lied herself down and went to sleep.     Not a problem.    Suddenly, one week ago, she stopped.    She won't sleep in her crib (nap or night)    She won't lay down in my bed (desperate attempt on my part).    She won't take a nap at all anywhere.     And, on top of it, she WILL not let me out of her sight for even a minute...extreme seperation anxiety.     We have spent the last week sleeping or not sleepign on the couch together...the only place I can get her the lie down with me.     Oh, I did try FERBER...3 hours straight of her yelling and bouncing in the crib.    (I gave up)    I can now get her to go to sleep in the crib at around 7pm    after 30 minutes of crying...but she wakes up sometime during the night and we are back on the couch.At first I thought i was a virus, then I thought it was a flu mist. Then I thought it was teething.    The child who was getting 16 hours of sleep is now lucky to get 8-10 hours.    She is exhausted!    I am doing ANYTHING to get her to sleep ANYWHERE.     I'm exhausted.     I'm tapped out of ideas.    Should I go to a toddler bed?    How do I reassure her that I'm not leaving her if she falls asleep?
FAML	Husband in denial	"I am going to Alanon tonight for the first time in hopes that I can clear my mind, that I am in fact not going crazy.I have been enabling my husband for 4 years now.    It wasn't until the past year that I have come to terms that my depression is related to watching him numb himself every night with 2 bottles of wine or equivalent of beer, and not being strong enough to tell him to stop. Why? because when I do, he turns into a battle about every topic under the sun...then he takes off in the car and threatens to look for a place to live.Last night I asked him why we have become so isolated from our friends and why our relationship is turning into roommates and not romantic partners, he shifts the blame on me. Telling me I haven't lost the baby fat after my pregnancy 2 years ago.    I am 115 pound 5'6 and my friends (the ones I still manage to keep) think if I get any skinnier I will be anorexic.But I made a promise to him that if I run every day, I want him to stop drinking. He agreed for the most part minus weekends.He was doing OK the past few weeks, I would say a total of 5 days off and on without drinking. However, the other night he was vomiting perfusely for hours. I told him it might be withdrawals and he shrugged it off as if I was crazy.Last night was the last straw.    I have relatives coming into town, so I needed to take a day off from running, but I was still over exerting myself cleaning and painting while he watched. Then he popped the bottle of wine and this feeling of betrayal came all over me. When I questioned why he was drinking, he said it was because I wasn't running. There I was working my A*%^ off and he went outside to smoke and drink.I feel I have done way more than my share in this marriage..- Financially supportive..since I make a considerable amount more than him- Responsible to pick up and drop off our baby - which makes my commute an hour long.- Not to mention the daily tasks when I get home to clean, cook, and run the dog (that he wants nothing to do with).But, now I need me to be under 100 pounds for him to even notice me.Why would he give up what I think is an amazing life for alcohol.     I always support him in all his other endeavors. he loved me for that at one time..Now he just criticizes me if I don't agree with him.I told him I was going to Alanon and his words were ""WHATEVER"".    I told him that I am tired of being angry and I am taking reposiblity for the mess I have put myself in, which is why I need Alanon.I don't think he will respond...but I know he will start looking for a place. That is is defense...Should I always be in fear of him leaving????    Should I just let him drink and turn my eyes? He's fine unless I bother him about his drinking."

DEMO	pain in bowels before/during and after pooing	I am a twenty one year old girl and i am very worried about my bowels and pooing. Sorry if this is a bit gross, im just hoping someone can give me some advice that doesnt involve a doctor (obvs if its needed then i will), if i can avoid it then it would be great. Over the past 3 months i have been in a lot of pain during pooing. It feels like there is a heavy brick constantly pressing in my bum. I have ibs (which ive had for years), and in the past ive bleed hilst pooing, due to the vast amount i go during the day. But this feels different to what i am used to experiencing. I get awful stomach cramps before i need to go, that often make me feel as if i am going to pass out, and then i get a heavy aching pain in my backside during and after. I feel constantly tired and run down, it literally exhausts me as i have to spend so much time on the toilet. It takes me so long to go, as it feels horrendous trying to actually go, and i am sometimes stuck on the toilet for anything up to an hour. If i get up and just give up, i instantly feel like i need to go again and reside myself to the pain of pooing rather than giving up and experiencing the cramps. I have been anally examined before, and it is mortifying, if theres anything anyone can sugesst i would reallyapprieciate it, and i wont take offence if someone's advice is going to the doctors.Thank youVery worried girl

PREG	Confused....Need Help!!!!	For the last 4 months I've been getting Quantative HCGs done so I can take my provera to bring on my period and start my clomid again.    The numbers on the HCG have always been less than 2.    I took a HPT this month and it was negative so they ordered bloodwork.    I work at a Drs office and looked up the results and the number is 8.    I have yet to hear from my Gyne but I'm going insane.    Is this still a negative or is there some kind of slight possibility that I might be?    I'm really hoping that there is some kind of miracle working here and I maybe ovulated late cause after trying for 15 months it kind of starts to wear on you!!            Any Advice??     Thanks!!!

SOCIAL ABUSE,PHYSICAL ABUSE,VERBAL ABUSE,EMOTIONAL ABUSE(all in one questions) All of my life I have people abuse me to the point were I am totally petrified of people now.My question is I want to to have friends socialize with people but how do get over this many many years of abuse with people that I've had to be enforced to deal with all of my life?I'm forty-one years old now and lonely.And everytime I hear that someone wants to get to know me socially I get so scared that litterally throw up with fear.I lack social skills REALLY bad.I go to chat with my neighbors and within a matter of a few days to a week they try to avoid me like the pleague.I don't dare to ask them why because I know the truth will never be told.I see a therapist we've had our share of problems and last week we were talking about some issues that I was doing at my place of conseling that took up our time.Well I am extemely over waite and I was mentioning that I would love to meet the son of one of neighbors if was not so over wait.My therapist had a look on its face as    if to say I agree to that.I didn't have time to bring it on up and I am going to on therapist's voicemail.I am REALLY angry with the therapist for doing that.Here I am with a very low self esteem and very subconscious of my looks and therapists dose this to me.So unfair so crewel so rotten to do especially with my bad past.I have been dealing with a wait issue for years.I am not going to let therapist weave its way out of this.No,not by along shot.,It hurt me its now made me more fearful of people and to even go in public now is a definite no no.My therapist is suppose to be helping not emotionally or psychologically abusing people like me especially someone with my kind of history background.And now I am more with drawn and    stay inside person now.I never go out now thanks to therapist.I have cried over this issue now and therapist has in just those few minutes have successfully reopened now every abuse wound that I have fought all of my life to heal and close.I came to therapist for help not for this kind treatment from therapist.Any there any way I can file a complaint against my therapist?

I absolutely recognize my thought process at the time is irrational, it just doesn't seem to help in the moment.

GOAL	cataract surgery first before macular hole surgery?	I am extremely myopic (my doctor says I have pathological myopia in both eyes).    My left eye has a pretty bad macular hole and I also have severe cataracts in the left eye (on the scale of 1 - 4, mine is a 3).    I've been to two retinal specialists, one who said that I should have the cataract surgery first and then have the retinal surgery to repair the hole, 2 weeks later.    The other said that she would do the retinal surgery first.    I am reluctant to have the retinal surgery at all, thinking that I might just live with the macular hole.    However, I was thinking that having the cataract surgery might help improve my vision, even by just a little bit.    My cataract surgeon told me it would be useless, the improvement being only so slight that I would hardly notice the difference.    He also said that because I am so severely myopic, the cataract surgery would increase the likelihood of future retinal detachments and might even worsen the macular hole or create some new retinal problems.    Why do cataract surgery for such small returns?    He will only do the cataract surgery if I agree to follow it up with retinal surgery.    What do you think?This discussion is related tomacular hole repair success rate.

FAML	5 year old boy acting out and misbehaving	My 5 year old son just started kindergarden this year and is very smart but, seems to keep getting notes home or calls from the teacher about how he hits someone or throws rocks at recess and then lies about it blameing someone else. I have tried everything from rewarding him for the good behavior with trips to chucky cheese or a new toy. I always make a big deal of it when he gets all good marks for the day but nothing is working. He continues to do these things. He gets grounded from doing fun things like playing outside with the neighbor boys or going fun places or the tv. At home he yells at me everytime he does not get his way and crys about everything unless it is what he wants. I have been trying to get him to talk to me about the way he is feeling by using words instead of throwing the fits. Any ideas on what I can do to get him to change the way he is acting?
SOCL	Confused about chest x-ray results	I had a chest xray because of a positive ppd. The tb results were negative, but the radiology report said that there is 'mild stenois', 'scarring' and 'pleural thickening left lateral base vs clothing artifact' (the artifact was probably the tie of my gown).    I'm 28, have never been sick other than the normal cold/flu thing, and had a chest xray 5 years ago that had nothing.I'm going to be taking the xray to my doctor once I get my hands on it and get an appointment. In the meantime, should I be concerned? Is this an indication of previous damage, or something current, or merely an uncertainty by the radiologist as to whether it was my lung or my clothing?

SOCL	Obama administration hikes CAFE fuel economy standard to 54.5 mpg	http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/technology-blog/obama-administration-hikes-cafe-fuel-economy-standard-54-163257022.htmlObama administration hikes CAFE fuel economy standard to 54.5 mpgBetween the Chevy Volt and the 2011 World Car of the Year Nissan Leaf, the United States has been making huge strides in increasing the average fuel economy of vehicles on the road. The Obama administration doesn't want the progress to stop there: After a year of negotiation, it finally reached a formal agreement with automakers and unions to raise the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) to a minimum 54.5 mpg by 2025.Currently, CAFE standards require automakers to average 35.5 mpg in the next four years, a target that's easily within reach. By raising the minimum fuel economy standards, car makers will be forced to push electric vehicles that dramatically raise a company's CAFE number. The United States will also be able to reduce OPEC oil imports by 50%.

SOCL	My issue with Porn	Ok well I have known for a while the my boyfriend watches porn. About 6 months ago I saw on him email a receipt from a porn site. I said something and he freaked saying that he is too tight with his money he wouldn't do that. If he wanted that he could just get on his paltalk account. Well come to find out last night I saw another receipt in his email and he has gone to that site a good bit. And its one of those chat sites, not even really porn. ?? But he doesn't stay for long, each session is about 2 or 3 mins long, no longer than that. So I mean he can't really be getting that into it for just 2 minutes. But it bothers me because he pays for 2 different sites, that I know of. One is the chat site and then the other one is acutally porn. But I feel like he looks at it all the time. I found another site saved in his favorites. I'm almost starting to feel like he would rather watch that by himself then be with me. It makes me feel like I'm not good enough. It would be different if I knew he didn't pay for it and that it wasn't the chat sites. That kinda bothers me a lot. I didn't sleep all night because of this. And he is the kind of person that if I bring up something he has done wrong he will get mad and it will start a huge fight. But he knows me and when something bothers me I just get quiet and not myself. I just don't know what to do or how to even bring it up. It hurts me a lot but I just don't think even if I say anything he will stop. Someone please give me some advice!!!

TRMT	What do you all hink about Candida overgrowth.	Hi everyone,I wasn't sure where to post this so Nutrition sounded like the best category. I am experiencing Candida overgrowth symtems based on the research I've done online. I don't think my doctor has ruled it out but he seems more concerned in finding other causes for my symptoms. My symptoms are primarily Angular Cheilitis and abdominal cramping. Oherwise I'm pretty healthy. The Angular Cheilitis always gets worse when I increase my sugar consumption, that is why I highly suspect Candida overgrowth. So I'm wondering if others have experience with this condition and/or symptoms.Thank you very much for any help.John

GOAL	cavities near fillings - dentist error?	Whenever I get fillings the fillings never feel completely smooth on my tooth. Almost like there's a little ridge between the filling and my tooth. Food gets caught there and now I have 3 definite cavities next to fillings. Two I can put off until I get to Marine bootcamp in three months where dental care will be free(woohoo!) but the one feels tender when I clean it out and I'm sure will be deep enough to require a root canal by that time if it doesn't already. Based on the horror stories of root canals at bootcamp I really don't want to have to do it there. So is my dentist wrong in not making sure the filling is completely smooth on my tooth? He has been seeing me for a few years now and knows what weak enamel I have.Also could veneers help someone like me who has really weak enamel?

FAML	disrespectful, know-it-all behavior	"My son, turning 7 in feb., has angry, know-it-all, respect issues. He is a loving, sweet boy at heart but when he doesn't get his way or is disciplined, he panics and then he gets so ANGRY!When he learns about a new topic (school, sports, games, ANYTHING), he thinks he's an    expert immediately, becomes belligerent, and doesn't want to be taught anymore about it. He talks in class so he misses instructions and blames other kids for distracting him. He talks over top of us, does not want to wait his turn to talk, yells to make his point and is convinced he is right about things he has little knowledge.I've seen so many children that take the word of their parents as the word of GOD! Not mine.He always knows better and second guesses what adults tell him. He lays blame on others and seems to think that when things don't go his way, or if he's disciplined, it is someone else's fault (ie: ""well if you wouldn't have done..., I wouldn't have to act like..."" or ""I'm being mean because you won't let me...""). It just won't blow over and he over reacts drastically even if it's just a matter of brushing his teeth, or turning the TV off to practice his reading or do some other activity.Even when he was 8mos. old, if we stopped him from doing something he wanted to do (ie: climbing things, playing w/ things he shouldn't), he would just freak out.He's very smart, good at math, loving, and he even says that he WANTS to behave. He confesses to me that it is very difficult for him NOT to react the ways he does.CAN ANYONE HELP???"

So I do believe it is not an sti, as i again have been tested. But I am curious if it could be caused do to too much vaginal discharge. or if its just from thee labia rubbing together...

DISE	Herpes!	Hi, this is a great site & i hope that someone can help me here. It is a long story and I will try to put it in a chronological order. I am a 28 year old male.On18th Jan'10 I came across a sex worker and indulged in Oral and vaginal sex. The oral sex was unprotected though for vaginal sex I had a condom on. The oral sex of blowjob lasted for 4-5 minutes and vaginal sex was only for couple of minutes. After couple of days of the encounter, 22st Jan'10    I started feeling some tingling in my genital area. Although worried I left it and after a period of 10 days or so the tingling went away itself.On 22nd Feb'10 I again started feeling the similar irritation & tingling around my penis coupled by frequent urge to urinate, I was having itching all over my body with red scars. I went to a GP next day who diagnosed for scabies and also gave me Zithromax of 250Mg to be taken 4 at a time at one go. For scabies I was given Derbac M solution. I was tested for a possible UTI, syphills and normal blood infection but all came negative I took the dosage as prescribed but the tingling sensation around my penis continued to exist though scabies went away.On 7th March'10 I got tested for Gonorrhea & Chlamydia    through a SWAB test and the result was also negative. On 26th April' 10 that is 97 days post the encounter I was tested for HIV which came out to be negative. In all the cases the report was given in 4-5 days. I have not experienced discharge or pain in penis though tingling sensation is there.The time went on however all of a sudden recently I again started feeling a similar ting around the tip of my penis followed by an increased frequency to urinate & dribbling. Also I feel dull pain around my shoulders, neck, forearms, thighs & groin. This is a mild pain and not something that I am unable to bear. Apart from this I also feel mild headache & bouts of stomach pain. The penis gets more uncomfortable when I am sitting.I have not seen any blisters or lesions around the genital area.    Since 18th Jan I have not indulged in any form of sexual activity and as a matter of fact that was my first ever intercourse in all these years of my life.I am getting really worried what this whole episode is all about. I have only seen one GP and considering to probably look out for a urologist. At this point of time I am not sure if this is an std like HIV, Herpes, HPV or UTI, NGU, Proststitis.The recent developments of pain and penis tingling is forcing me to think its HIV!Also, with regards to above I have following questions.1) What are the chances of HIV not showing up even after 97 days?2) What these symptoms sound like, in particular pain around neck, stomach & headache?3) Is Prostatitis similar to some form of STD's or HIV?4) What are my options hereon? Is it Herpes?Kindly help me.I originally posted this question IN STD forum but was suggested to re post in HIV forum.
PREG	Strange situation! Pregnant?	Okay, here's the deal! My period is usually anywhere from every 14-42 days and as of right now I haven't had one in 61 days! Crazy.Might I add that they usually last 5-7 days.Last time I was intimate was early September, and since then I've had a period in October for four days then another one in November after 42 days but again only lasted four days. I haven't seen a period since and it's now mid-late January.I'm dizzy, nauseous, sore back, tender breasts, and my stomach is firmer. Also this morning I woke up and saw that my tummy was beating or pulsating which was a first ever for me!! I could and be paranoid or 'broken' but I'm reaching out to see if anyone else had similar experiences at all. Before I struggle to find money for a pregnancy test I'd like others opinion. I'm a student and rather broke right now, so no, I dont think I could gather 10$. Let me know what you think before I ask my pals.

My whole mouth hurts. the bottom wisdom teeth were already out but leaning twards my other teeth causing them to be slightly impacted I suppose but I didnt need an oral surgeon apparently the dentist did the extraction. it took about an hour to do the one that was causing the pain and about 30 min to do the other one. The dentist was wonderful considering my lack of oral care thusfar, I skipped work for a day and went back today, when I got home I was throbbing and It hasnt stopped.

SOCL	False Positive Drug Screen.....WHY is this happening	I have recently had two urine drug screens come back showing trace amounts of Oxycodone.    I have NOT taken this drug.    I suffer from severe chronic pain in my back and have been prescribed Dilaudid for almost 3 years, which I take regularly on a daily basis and without it I am totally bedridden.    I recently changed doctors and as part of a Provincial Program for regular use of controlled narcotics, I have to submit to random drug screens to prove I do not use illicit (street) drugs or any medications that are not prescribed to me and that patients who are prescribed narcotics are not selling them and not taking them.    I am absolutely fine with this program and confident submitting to the testing because I take my prescribed medication regularly and have absolutely nothing to hide.    I have submitted two samples of urine on two different occasions 6-8 weeks apart and both results came back showing my Dilaudid but also showing *trace* amounts of Oxycodone in my urine sample.    Why could this be happening to me?    It is threatening my treatment and making me look dishonest to my new doctor, as people who DO use drugs they are not prescribed and street drugs always say they didnt' use them when their results come back positive.    Of course, I am telling him this as well and he is saying every patient he has will deny they didn'[t do the drug when their screen comes back positive, just like I am saying to him!!    I need to know what I can suggest as testing to prove it is something in my system causing this false-positive result and also an explaination for him why it is showing trace amounts of Oxycodone when I have not taken any of this drug.    Medically, I usually have protein in my urine on testing in small amounts from kidney damage years ago and have rheumatoid arthritis.    I have no other medical conditions that I know of, which is also a concern, as I am worried because I have read so much online that this test result may mean something is awry in my system and showing up in a different way....(eg: diabetes, kidney failure etc).    Can someone with expertise in the lab testing area please help me bring some information forward to my doctor in terms of what I should be tested for as I may have a rare molecule in my urine etc........this is threatening my treatment with my regularly prescribed medication and I have to prove i am not taking ANY Oxycodone and not lying about it.    Please help if you know anything I can research or suggest to him that we test for.

SOCL	US born illegal&#x27;s	So with all the talk about various states passing laws around illegal immigration, I started to think about a CNN documentary I saw a month of so ago.    It profiled and talked to children of illegal immigrants who were born in the US.    These were good kids, all getting ready for college, and the focus was on whether or not they should be allowed to stay or deported along with their parents (if deportation was in fact the final decision).    All these kids knew was the US and they just wanted to go to college and make something of themselves (again, these were the kids interviewed,).    Most had never even visited the country of their parents birth.    I was wondering what others thought...should those kids be allowed to stay, or should they also be deported?
SOCL	My daddy died last june the day before fathers day	Its like I'm frozen with denial only if I look at his picture a tear will roll down my cheek and then I push it away. I can verbalize that he is gone to heaven but its like my mind doesn't really get it. I suffer from borderline personality disorder , chronic depressive, and bi polar. I'm afraid that I'm gona forget my daddy if I can move ahead in my grief, only my mind and my meds won't let me. Will I forget Him, I love him so much and miss him and it was he who named me toots. Oh how I want to hear him call me that again. I feel myself pushing everyone away from me and all I want is tp be left alone. Is this my mental illness or grief. Is there anybody that can help me.
SOCL	Iraq Reconstruction Cost U.S. $60 Billion	"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/03/06/iraq-reconstruction_n_2819899.html?ncid=webmail10WASHINGTON -- In nine years of war in Iraq, 4,448 Americans died and 32,221 were wounded in battle, leaving behind a deeply divided country steeped in corruption. And despite a $60 billion U.S effort to rebuild Iraq, life for most Iraqis has not improved significantly, according to a bitter and regretful retrospective by Iraqi officials and U.S. diplomats, military officers and politicians.Their views come with the final report of the Special U.S. Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction, released Wednesday. Congress set up the SIGIR office in November of 2003 to monitor the vast sums of Iraqi and U.S. money being spent by the U.S. occupation authorities in Baghdad.Over nine years, Inspector General Stuart W. Bowen and his staff relentlessly tracked down what happened to the $146 billion in Iraqi money and the $60 billion in U.S. funds -- much of it airlifted to Iraq in pallets of shrink-wrapped $50 bills. Despite the claims of President George W. Bush and other U.S. officials that the United States would rebuild an even better Iraq after the March 2003 invasion and occupation, the money ""underperformed,"" Bowen noted dryly in the report.""There was misspending of money,"" said Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, in one of the colossal understatements contained in the massive report.The one bright spot, the report said, was the $20.2 billion the United States spent to train and equip Iraqi security forces, which have managed to keep Iraq relatively stable despite rising political tensions and sectarian violence.But apart from the detailed investigations and assessments in the final SIGIR report, it is the observations of senior Iraqi and American officials that are most damning. Bowen and his staff talked with Maliki and Iraqi politicians and jurists, former Ambassador Ryan Crocker, former Gen. David Petraeus and Gen. Ray Odierno, now U.S. army chief of staff.Bush, former Vice President **** Cheney, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and L. Paul Bremer -- who ran Iraq in the crucial years of 2003 and 2004 as head of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) -- did not offer their own assessments.There is little chance that the United States, given the difficult lessons of its wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, will embark on a major invasion and military occupation any time soon. But if it did, the ineptness and hubris of the U.S.-led reconstruction effort will serve as a guide to how it shouldn't be done.""The level of fraud, waste and abuse in Iraq was appalling,"" Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) told SIGIR. She said she had urged the White House to make careful loans to Iraq for reconstruction, but Bush had insisted on a ""no strings attached"" approach instead.A senior Iraqi bank auditor, Dr. Abdul Basit Turki al-Sae'ed, who has led many investigations of Iraqi government spending, said the flood of U.S. dollars into the country had fostered a ""triangle of political patronage"" among Iraq's political parties, sectarian groups and government officials that sparked corruption and terrorism.Former Iraqi Prime Minister Ibrahim al-Ja'afari said Iraq's oil profits, which in 2003 and 2004 were spent by Bremer's CPA, were ""gravely mismanaged,"" eroding the country's educational and medical facilities and sapping its ability to provide such basics as electricity.U.S. Army Chief of Staff Odierno, who commanded in Iraq for six of the war's nine years, said in retrospect it would have been better to have held off major U.S. investments in reconstruction projects until five or six years into the war, when U.S. troops and U.S.-trained and equipped Iraqi forces were beginning to bring the violence under control.In 2004, for instance, the U.S. launched an ambitious project to build a sewer and water system in Fallujah, a center of intense and bloody sectarian fighting. Originally slated to cost $35 million and take 18 months to complete, the project so far has cost $195 million and is scheduled to be finished in 2014.Raheem al-Ugaili, a judge and head of Iraq's Commission on Public Integrity until 2011, pursued dozens of corruption investigations involving U.S.-funded projects until he was fired for reaching too deeply into Iraq's political elite.""Vast amounts of money were wasted without attaining actual intended results,"" al-Ugaili told SIGIR. He identified one major problem common to U.S. reconstruction efforts: Americans excluded Iraqis from the planning and prioritizing of projects.But worse than simply wasted money and incomplete projects was the culture of corruption left behind. ""Sketching out a grim picture of Iraq's anti-corruption institutions in full retreat, the judge asserted that the level of kickbacks to [Iraq government] officials and the volume of money laundering continue to grow,"" SIGIR reports.That culture has seeped into the U.S. involvement in Afghanistan as well, according to Ryan Crocker, who served as ambassador to Afghanistan from 2011 to 2012 after leading the political-military campaign in Iraq from 2007 to 2009 with Petraeus. Corruption, cost over-runs and unfinished construction of U.S.-funded projects in Afghanistan are documented in regular reports from the U.S. Special Inspector General For Afghan Reconstruction (SIGAR), also a congressionally mandated watchdog.Crocker told SIGAR that the United States had done a better job in Afghanistan in including local Afghans in the planning process. But as in Iraq, he said, the United States had launched ambitious projects for which Afghans had neither the expertise nor the money to operate.For instance, he said Afghanistan lacks the money to maintain the new road system built with reconstruction funds.""We're already seeing them crumbling,"" he said."

GOAL	MANY TINE FLOATING SPECS AFTER MACULAR HOLE SURGERY	Sept. 2nd, silicone oil was removed after macular hole surgery.    On Sept. 15th I stopped all eye drops, tapering off of the cortisone for 4 days. Sept. 17th noticed hundreds of tiny floating specs.    Being afraid of a retinal tears, I returned and had a comple eye exam.    My group of opthalmologists are noted as being some of the best. Two days later, another recheck exam with another opthalmooigist (my primary is on vaction.) The conclusion that I stopped the cotisone drop too soon, without properly tapering off and these specs are inflamatory cells., or pigment cells.    I began to taper off at 4 drops a day for a week, now 3 for a week, now 2 for a week.    Oct. 6, the specs are still present in abundance.    There is no change.    I have another appointment in two weeks.    Is it possible that a retinal tear can be so small as to produce symptoms and yet go undetecked in an exam?    Have anyone ever heard of this phenomenon.Thank you.

GOAL	dehydration	Heart rate staying higher than normal after exercise?I am 15 male. After some intense running today at basketball, very strenous and intense my heart rate stayed within the normal range( 60-100) but higher than normal. usually my resting heart rate is 68-75 beats per minute. But after i ran a lot at practice it rose to like 95-104 when i checked about an hour or 2 after runninglike its barely in the normal range. My blood pressure is normal and feel fine. I do not drink alot of water during running. But after the running today i drank about 4-5 cups of water till now. Is it really dehydration? or could i be dehydrated which is causing this increase in heart rate.I have had 2 Ekg['s and an echo done which came out normal for anxiety. I am still wondering why its been about 2 hours since the last time I ran like when will it start going down? Is there something wrong? It has happened once before again with a lot of running it slowly step by step came back down to about 68-75 within 3-4 hours.Also when i am at rest my heart rate is forceful and strong when it beats fast like this it is just like really fast with not much force in it. That might be stating the obvious but i dont know.It was down to about 90 as i write this question it is 80-85. Like how long does it take to recover from dehydration i am constantly drinking water like i said 5 cups till now,

TRMT	Anyone else getting severe headaches and more.....	Hello all I just decided to see what the side effects of Mirena were after being told how wonderful it was and that it had very little side effects. I was talked into it after having my 3rd child in 4yrs and because they couldn't tie my tubes right after delivery due to complications this was the next best thing.....I have had headaches for a long time but since getting this thing I have had the most god awful headaches...they are so severe the past 2 or 3 times I have considered going to the ER. They are what you call cluster headaches which in a way are worse than a migraine (they start on one side of my face mainly at night while I am sleeping, my eyeball will feel like it is going to pop out from the pressure, it goes all the way down my neck and than it will switch sides or be on one side of my head and down the back of my head....sometimes it will last for more than a day or go away than come back) and I got them before but maybe every 6 mos or so now I am getting them about every 2 wks or more if I don't catch it in timeI was also suffering from bad post partum depression but they still did the insert and now I feel a cross between a zombie and a raving lunatic but thought it was just me.....I have noticed some weight gain but I honestly hardly eat as I don't have much of an appetite.....I had pain with sex and after was even worse and than when it gets close to that time of the month I hurt so bad in my ovaries.....Right after having it inserted I bled for I think 3 or 4 months straight but thought it was normalI was already under a lot of stress before having this thing put in but this seems to have made it all worse and I feel so guilty because I know my little ones are suffering because I just don't feel well ever and right now I am so depressed with raging mood swings....Lately my whole body aches like I have arthritis or somethingAnother thing is anyone else having there sleep affected by it?I want it out but waiting on a dr appt
TRMT	Hormonal Problems Post Hyst	"I had a abdominal hysterctomy in November 2007 that left me with one ovary, since that time, I have severe mood swings every 28-30 days.    They are becoming increasingly worse each month.    I cry for no reason, accuse those around me of doing things I know (on a normal day) that they would never do.    I scream one minute, and sob uncontrollable the next.    I was recently forced to change doctors due to a change of insurance, this new Physician states that one ovary is more than sufficient.    He checked my hormones during ""normal"" times, but refuses to check them during the ""rough"" days.    Please help me, I feel like I'm driving myself crazy and driving away those I love.Thanks"

DISE	Levothyroxine and increasing LDL, Cholesterol	"Hi, I have been on Levothyroxine since July 2011, 50 MCG daily, also 5mg quinapril daily since then. I was under the impression that synthroid improves cholesterol levels. My doctor told me. He also recommended fish two or three times a week, and lamb otherwise. I eat red meat once or twice a week and salmon three times.Physically, you would not think I need to be on these meds. I am thin and athletic, a swimmer's body. I work out six days a week.My total cholesterol level one year ago before these meds was 191. My TSH increased from 4.5 to 7.75 and that is when I was put on the meds. My BP spiked at one point due to my panic attack of a diagnosis of hypertensive heart disease, and then I was put on quinapril. Months since, I feel great. Joint pain about gone, much improved digestion. TSH measured 1.83 in November. Blood pressure under control. I am an avid fitness swimmer and swim seven or eight miles a week. I run too.My latest cholesterol level measures 235. My cardiologist endorses my swimming, did not prescribe meds, and only suggested doubling my supplement of red yeast rice, which I have done.I am bewildered. Why is my cholesterol and LDL increasing? I try eating healthy. The only ""good"" thing I gave up was green tea, one because my seven cups a day ended up giving me kidney stones and two, because the flouride in it clashes with synthroid.Comments please?"
DEMO	Body hair	Hi! My question is about excessive body hair and its relation to fertility.I would not say i have too much of body hair but i have growth(though medium growth) at locations such as chin,around nipples and around the navel.I would not call that the hair is very thick or coarse but i have to remove it by threading every 15 days or so.I dont know if this could be called as hirsutism bcoz i do not suffer from PCOS or anything.My body weight is perfect and i have regular cycles.I have been ttc for nearly 9 months without success.All our reports are normal.I read somewhere that this hair growth is due to the prodution of excessive male hormone testosterone.I was just wondering if there could be any relation between this hair growth and fertility.
GOAL	Dentures & Coughing	My Mother in Law (75) has coughing fits several times a day.    She's been checked by a Dr. and it is nothing to do with her health.    Several dentists have said that because she does not take her dentures out at night and does not rinse them throughout the day it is causing the coughing.    We are looking for someone to confirm this and if there is any information on line about this.    She has some short term memory issues so if I can get it in writing for her maybe she will believe us when we tell her to rinse her mouth out and that her dentures need to come out at night!
SOCL	Husbands lack of helping around the house has ruined our sex life	I married a man 13 years younger than me.    I love him very much, he is my soul mate, he is a good man and we had a great sex life our first 2 years together.    We have been together 5 years and we hardly ever fight I am happier than I have every been and feel lucky to have my life.    However, lately, I am having issues with him wanting sex more than I do. I want to be the one to initiate sometimes and that never happens.    I usually end up giving in just so he will leave me alone sometimes and that just isn't right.    I do like sex, and he is a loving and caring partner, that isn't the issue.     The biggest issue I think is that he is younger and I have issues with getting him to help more around the house.    I work more than he does, I take care of all the bills, I manage his business and mine, and I have to remind him to do all the things he is supposed to me doing which most of the time I end up doing. I am exhausted most of the time.    The house is a mess because I dont have time and he is supposed to do it but it gets so bad to the point I can't have people over, or have no dishes and am drinking out of tupperware bowls because we have no clean glasses.    I have a hard time living in an environment that is so messy and chaotic, I literally want to go stay in a hotel sometimes.    He will wait until the dishes are so bad that we have maggots in the sink before he will get to them sometimes.    Our car engine blew up because he never kept up with the maintance and I had to deal with getting that fixed.    I spend my only time off cleaning.    I ask him for help, I tried making task lists, I tried giving him space, I have tried everything and nothing seems to work.    I try to have him help with simple things like errands, but he feels if he does one thing for the day he is done.    He can't multi task to save his life.    He works, comes home and gets on hist computer or his xbox and plays games.    This is the only thing he likes to do so I don't want to take that away from him since he always comes home to me and isnt out at clubs or with his friends all the time like some husbands.    But I just wish he would spend 2 hours    day helping me.    Most of this is my fault, I enabled him because I had more experience than running a house and a business so I did just take over these things naturally, so I think he is just used to me doing everything.    When I tried to get him to help, he just couldn't get into the groove I guess and I probably was a little rough on him because he wasn't doing things right.    I almost relate it to how I felt as a teenager, when mom gave you choirs and you shirked them because you knew in the end she would do them or she would just take over because you weren't doing them right.    I struggle with trying to get him to learn how I had to learn when I was on my own and became responsible.     I am not sure how to get him there, that is an ongoing struggle.    The biggest problem now is that it has affected our sex life, he wants sex from me daily and I get so annoyed because I feel like it is just one more thing I have to do, like another job or another task I have no control of.    I resent him for not helping me more and have told him if he helped me more I would feel more in the mood.    In fact, when I seem him take initiative it makes me look at him differently and I want to have sex with him.    I give him lots of affection, even initiating sex when he is in the middle of a choir, hoping to inspire him more.    I have expressed to him that his lack of help is affecting me physically and mentally.    3 months ago I ended up having to get 45 stitches in my hand because he didn't help me move something so when I tried I got hurt.    He felt awful and for a short time seemed to snap out of it.    But it didn't take long for him to go back to his old ways.    He loves me and I know if he really understood that it hurts me he isn't helping, that he would step up.    I have told him this is what is affecting our sex life and he is trying to help more but I am still overwhelmed.    I think he things I am superwoman and so he just doesn't get it.    I worry that if we can't resolve this, our marriage will be in trouble.    I have run out of ideas on how to fix this.

DISE	Extreme Knee Pain/no swelling/no injury	I'm a female ... mid forties... active and up until now, in good healthI've never had a problem with my knees, but a week ago I was laying across the bed and a severe pain struck me behind the knee cap. I was in tears instantly.It is a constant pain... varying from a dull ache and amping up to a crescendo of high pitch... There is no pattern to it... walking or laying down makes no difference. There is no position where there is relief.I don't like to take pain pills, they upset my stomach but had a few Loratabs left from a dental problem. They lowered the volume, but still the pain was intense. My family doctor referred me to an orthopedic surgeon and prescribed Percocet until my appointment. Same results as the Loratabs.The pain in my knee set off a topical pain down the front of my shin... I can control that with Elcon cream. It also affects the Sartorius muscleÃ¢ € , but I can vibrate that and it stops. Those areas have different types of pain, but both radiate from the knee.2 days ago I woke up and a brown bruise about the size of a quarter was on the side of my knee cap. It's not a bad bruise, but there are 2 black dots about half inch apart inside of the bruise. They look like small punctures, sort of like you get with a shot.Today, I saw the specialist... I've used him before for a frozen shoulder and had excellent results with a cortisone type injection in the shoulder joint.He took a few images and couldn't see a problem. Then he spent about 20 minutes checking all the pressure points. He explained, that certain points when pressed would indicate the problem and that I wouldn't be able to stand his touching it. Nothing hurt any worse when he pressed, but the pain was already severe. When I didn't react, he checked them again and was puzzled by my lack of reaction.When he saw the bruise, he questioned me at length about how it got there. When I finally made him understand, it just came there while I was asleep, he said he'd never seen anything like that. I asked if there was something leaking from under the kneecap and he said no.He said that without further tests, he couldn't tell what was wrong. He said, this was the first time in his career he had seen a patient be in such pain, without responding when the pressure point was pressed. I asked him about tests and he said an MRI.... Without explanation, that is out for me.I asked for a cortisone shot and he agreed to try it... but said it might take as long as 72 hours to feel the full effect. He didn't come right out and say it, but he didn't appear to think it would do much good... but wouldn't hurt to try.Has anyone here had a similar problem, or know of something I can ask him to check?Thanks in advance for any informationSassy_

She has moved 9 times in the last 5 years, and her mother doesnt pay her much attention. lately she has been talking back a lot, acting out, lying constantly even about petty stuff and stuff we know can ONLY be her, then when confronted again with new evidence she blames someone else (like her mother), she is pretending to have sisters and brothers while on the phone with friends (even changes her voice to ""pretend"" to be them), likes a new boy every other day, combing her hair constantly, changing clothes more than 2 times a day (this part has been going on for a while) however she does this behavior in spurts...one week she will 2 weeks she wont then for a whole week she will ect..; seeks attention no matter what kind.I have tried to sit her down and get to bottom of emotions even telling her about my bad childhood, hoping to get her to cry (to release emotions) but she quickly tries to change subject (and i mean very quickly) I have offered her rewards for doing GOOOD things, even recently promised to buy her a Nintendo DS (which i WILL) if she promises NOT TO talk back to her Grandma (her grandma old and lives with us and cant take the stress) I even gave her three allowed mess ups (strikes) before taking away DS...This is something she wants too...all she had to do was go one month!!!! she blew it in 4 days....practically on purpose....Now granted a month is long for a kid to be an angel...I let ALOT of stuff slip but some stuff i had to give her the strike for especially telling grandma to shut the ""h"" up!!!!! PLEASE HELP does this sound like a borderline personality issue...or something less serious? Should i try to get the root of this out of her or allow her to see professional.?"
FAML	How to care for stubborn parent?	I hope this is the correct forum for my question.    My father had two strokes in the last seven years.    I am an only child, so my mother and I take care of him.    He no longer works, but sometimes drives to buy groceries since it's close to home.    My question is -- how do you take care of someone who does not want to be taken care of?He is the most stubborn person I know.    My mother is a nurse, yet he won't listen to her when she tells him he needs to take his medicine or watch what he eats.    In 2003, he had his first stroke after basically eating the whole pie of Papa John's pizza.    We thought that would be his reality check.    Guess what?    It wasn't.Then 3 years ago, he had a second stroke.    Reality check?    No.    He still does not believe in doctors, nor medicine. He has diabetes, just like his father, grandfather, great-grandfather, etc.    He also has high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and arthritis.    He refuses to believe that his stroke was caused by anything else besides diabetes.He has also suffered from depression for years, even before the stroke.    He was married with two children before he met my mother. I'm sure that's one reason why he's been depressed all his life.    Not to mention he was the eldest of 8 children and had to leave school to work and take care of them.    He does not want to move in with his brothers and sisters (who are also retired but on the other side of the country), because of pride.Lately he's been having memory lapses after waking from naps.    We don't know if these are mini-strokes, or just part of the long-term effects of strokes.    Again, he is stubborn; he does not want to call his doctor about this.    He says he's fine, but I'm scared that one day something serious will happen to him.    Since I'm an only child, he's home alone whenever my mother's at work and I'm at work or class.    No one is there to watch him and make sure he takes his meds or doesn't overdose on them.    We worry that when he has his memory lapses, he'll overdose on the meds, not realizing he had already taken them.Please, if anyone could shed some light on how to deal with this, it would be greatly appreciated.

GOAL	Help for CSR	I'm 35 and I first noticed the distortion in my left visual field about 7 yrs ago.    It was very slight.    It became very noticeable in the summer of 2007 and has persisted since then.    At that time (summer 2007) I was diagnosed with CSR.    My doctor told me there was nothing to be done and we'd just watch it and that it should just go away on its own, but it hasn't. There are many times I don't notice it (or my brain compensates via the normal vision I have in my right eye) but it's always there and I find myself closing my right eye to see if it's still there.    A little depressing.    The doctor said laser isn't an option due to the location being central and the risk of permanent visual loss is greater.    I've read about Avastin and Lucentis.    I have an identical twin brother that has normal vision.    I'd like to get back to that place.    What can I do? I'm starting to take eye vitamins, which the doctor said really wouldn't do anything, but I'm willing to try almost anything.    I have another appt on Dec 12 (2009). Since my last appt 3 months ago (when I had 20/30) it seems like my vision in my left eye has gotten a little blurrier.    What can I do to remove the fluid build up under my retina?

DEMO	I have a Bicornuate Uterus, will Mirena work for me?	Hi, I am 35 years old and have had 3 children, one has passed away due to congenital heart disease, which could have been due to my uterus. I have a bicornuate uterus-heart shaped-(which I just found out about, a small fibroid (2 cm), heavy long periods with a brown mucus discharge, painful intercourse, bad headaches during the end of my periods and horrible lower back pain. I went to my obgyn for several years with complaints and she never did tests or anything on me, so I just switched doctors and she have been running tests on me. The ultrasound showed heart shaped uterus and a fibroid. She also did a test to check for cancer which was negative. She said that I could possibly have endometriosis. She said my options are Mirena (iud- used as birthcontrol) or a hysterectomy. The pill is out due to past issues with headaches and the pill. So we talked about trying the Mirena first to see if that would help me, but I am have second thoughts about it. The more I read about it the more it makes me wonder. Like it is mainly used for birth control, not problems with periods. I am not having any more children and my husband has had a vasectomy, so I don't need to worry about birth control. Also does it work with a heart shaped uterus? Then do I want to feel better for a few years then have the same problems again later with the same options? With the Mirena it will make your periods heavier before they get lighter, what fun! Has anyone else had the same problems or used a Mirena for the same reasons? Should I try the mirena first or just get a hysterectomy? Thanks.. dsmegnky

PREG	Any suggestions on conquering the zipper???	"My oldest son is 4 - a young 4, his birthday is in early October.    He just started Junior Kindergarten this year and is doing pretty well, despite being one of the youngest in his class (entry into school is by calendar year here - ie. all kids born at any point in 2006 were eligible to attend Junior Kindergarten in the 2010-2011 school year).Anyway, our latest ""task"" is helping him learn how to do up his zipper independently.    He can dress himself fine otherwise (except for buttons).    His teacher says that his fine motor skills are a bit weak and he just needs help strengthening his hands (she suggested using play doh - hiding something small inside and getting him to dig it out, make things like letters, numbers and shapes with it, etc.).    Now she's handing out ""zipper licenses"" in class to the children who can do up their zippers independently and so we've been working with our son to help him master this skill.    He's made some progress, in that he can now place his hands in the correct spots for manoeuvering the zipper into the right spot, but, although he can pull the zipper up fine, he can't ""start"" it by himself.    He has always been a bit slow in figuring these things out - but he always does, so I'm not deeply concerned about it.    I just wonder if anyone has any tips or suggestions for me in order to facilitate this?I'm dreading teaching him how to tie shoe laces....!!    ;)"

DISE	1-month vertigo following heat exhaustion	"I'm a 37-year old male in excellent physical condition, swam in college and have been competing in triathlons for 15 years.    Exactly 1 month ago I went for a 2-hour 35 mile bicycle ride in the blazing Florida summer heat (I know, not the smartest move)    Though I've trained in the heat before and brought fluids with me on the ride, the 100+ heat index took it's toll.    I ended up with extremely severe heat exhaustion toward the end of the ride, I probably should have went to the ER following my return home.Upon awaking the next day I had a severe, crushing headache with pressure.    Four weeks after this incident I have sensations of vertigo when moving my head side to side, up or down, or bouncing my head such as when I run.....it's as if my eyes can't follow along with my head.    Standing up after I've been sitting also creates this vertigo effect.    The vertigo also creates an unsteadiness to my balance. I've also noticed a feeling of pressure in the upper, inside corners of both my eyes and discomfort moving my eyes from side to side.    This vertigo has all but put a hold on my exercise as any head movement triggers the sensation.Also of note, I assume as a side effect of the extreme heat exhaustion, I appear to have become heat intolerant.    Any exposure to stagnant heat, even without exercise, and my heart rate shoots the roof along with associated dizziness.    During these episodes I just can't get my heart rate to come down and must quickly get into an air condtioned building.    Almost called 911 as one time I nearly fainted.Being I've never felt any of these symptoms before I fear the severe heat exhaustion/exertion has caused all this.    I went to a neurologist 3 weeks ago for a physical exam and MRI of the brain and all came back OK.    Neurologist just told me to ""rest.""    My GP did blood work and all came back normal, blood pressure was normal, he recommended I see an ENT Specialist.Could this be something vascular that occured in the brain that wasn't picked up on the MRI?    Could severe dehydration & heat exhaustion trigger these symptoms?    Could the vertigo be due to a sinus infection or inner ear issue?    I'm concerned as I've never experienced vertigo like this before and never had a month-long headache before.    Thanks for any advice!"

FAML	Anger Management and Tantrums	I am at wits end with my 8 year old son who has anger issues and after a period of seeming better now seems worse.He has clothes issues and will only wear certain clothes .... getting him to shower/wash his hair is also another issue I am waiting for my family doctor to send him for testing but yet it takes so long to get an appointment. What can I do in the interim,    any discplinary action names me as a 'Mean Mum' it seems to be his way or no way, now winter is setting in I have coat and boot issues to contend with and finding it more and more trying. Taking him to choose his own clothes I thought would be a solution yet still seems to prove not a solution! I was hoping he would grow out of it by now?? But now worried there is a chemical in balance hense my going to the family doctor who seems in no rush to have him tested, we are awaiting an appointment for a Pediatric psychiatrist how long should I wait before seeking another opinion, emotionally it is draining and what energy I have ( I have lots ) I find it is disrupting the whole family. His eating is poor and probably part of his condition and adding to home challenges, at school he is doing fine so ADHD does not seem to be issue ( well that I know of ) anyone with any advise would be greatly appreciated, what to do next?Worried Mum

SOCL	Scalp Folliculitis (Extreme Hair Breakage)	Hi,I've been having issues with my hair breaking in the center of head for about 3 1/2 years. Recently a small spot in the back of my head has randomly startied to break too. My hair just won't stop splitting, everytime I shampoo or comb it theres hair everywhere. I'm an African American female and my hair is thick to say the least, it's not thinning it just keeps breaking and splitting like crazy in the same spot. I don't have issues like dry scalp or dandruff, or any bumps to my knowledge. My scalp itches sometimes, but it's not an all day everyday issue for me. I wash and condition my hair at least 2 times a week and try to keep it moisturized.I recently saved up money to visit a dermatologist and was diagnosed when folliculitis, all the guy did was barely touch my scalp. He says it's bumpy, although I beg to differ, he's the professional so I took his word.    I was prescribed the doctor's OWN brand of hair products (shampoo containing Salycylic Acid and Sulfur and conditioner) along with Dipronex Lotion (which really dries out my hair). One of the possible side effects of the Dipronex is folliculitis...why would he prescribe it for me? I was wondering what's a way to deal with scalp folliculitis with OTC products?I'm at my wit's end :(         ...any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated! :)

FAML	Worried Step-mother with a 4 yr old & 3 yr old	My husband and I recently received his kids in October 2010 from their mother (who didn't want them anymore). Since we have had them, we have noticed weird behavior from them.Just the other day, I was looking in my digial camera and noticed alot of pictures of them taking pictures of each others butts, and penis. It disturbs me because I have 2 kids myself (7 yr daughter & 6 yr son). The youngest (3 yr old) tried to touch my daughter on the butt(she had pants on) while she laying down on the sofa watching a movie. All I can do is put him in timeout..We talked to them when the camera thingy was discovered.I don't know what happen while ith their mother and her boyfriend, but that's only the beginning... The small one seems to have more angry problem about something, his even played in his own fecus (2 times already), his pooped in my shower while I gave him a shower. His hit me twice, as if he was an adult, his even fights and hit his father.My point of view, I think he has saw something at his mother's house...We have ask her and she states no way, but recently i found her profile on facebook where she is posing naked pictures of herself.we do not in anyway show anything we should not in front of the kids. Can anybody give us some advice? Should I take him back to his doctor and have him checked for sexual abuse? Is it to late to tell? I called to schedule appointment with psysc...but due to weather(snowed in) we could not go, now I'm having to reschedule. Your advice would be nice of you...Because I don't wont my kids to be put in this mess much. And I have told all of the kids, if someone touches you, come tell us!
DISE	Panic attack or something else?	Lately I've been having spells that come on at no certain time and last for a minute or up to a few minutes. I feel my head getting hot, start to sweat then get a spaced out feeling like I'm looking through binoculars or everything seems far away. Then I get nervous or shaky. I've never had this before and wonder if they are panic attacks. I've had my heart checked several times by different drs and they all tell me my heart is fine.My first thought was my ears because they are always ringing really loud and my balance is off sometimes. I also feel stuffed up. But I don't understand what the sweating and hot flash to the head is and why I feel spaced out or why it comes on so sudden.Does this sound like panic attacks? I'm going to check with my Dr but I was wondering if this sounds like this. Do panic attacks come on all of a sudden and what causes them?
GOAL	double vison	"At a party the day after I returned from a camping trip in the jungle in Belize I experienced binocular diplopia.    I'd had no alcohol to drink.    Someone took me home but I have no memory of that, promptly fell into a deep sleep and woke up several hours later.    Another episode occurred two days later and a third two weeks after that.    The third time I again fell into a deep sleep for about 45 minutes afterwards though I feel alert while the double vision is happening.    It goes away if I close either eye.    Otherwise I feel fine.    After the third episode I went to the ER.    I was told I was having mild seizures.    An MRI, MRA and spinal tap were all neg as was a f/u EEG.    What next?    Do I assume this is just some ""bug"" I picked up in the jungle and will resolve itself?    Are there any other diagnostic studies that should be done? How long before it is safe to drive again?"

DISE	gallstone & back pain	Hi,I'm 24 years of age, and for the past week I've been having back pains, mostly in my shoulders, middle of my back and lower back. Last night, after eating dinner (spaghetti) I had a really strange feeling in my stomach. I've always had a weak stomach, I get a lot of stomach aches but this feeling was different, it was tight, and heavy and ran across my upper abdomen. I could    barely sleep @ night because when I laid down on my stomach it was so painful and I felt a bit nauseous. I went to the ER this morning and found out I had a gallstone. Until I found out that I had a gallstone, the pain was always in my left side, but now since I found out about the gallstone I get pain in my right and left.The ultrasound was clear on my left side. Both my kidneys and stuff are clear, and there isn't any inflammation in my abdomen, it's just that one gallstone. It's starting to give me problems now, the right side hurts, I have back pain, right under my shoulder blades, dead smack in the middle and my lower lower back hurts, towards my tail bone I guess.. and not to mention I still get pains in the left side, plus abdominal discomfort. The dr gave me meds for the abdominal discomfort but its so damn uncomfortable I can barely eat anything. I'm afraid to eat anything!I have no idea why my left side hurts.. could it be the pain from the right just spreading across to the left? And should I just get my gallstone out? The thing is, I'm just a bit hesitant because I'm living overseas so I don't feel too comfortable, I mean, even the dr said I should get it in America

SOCL	Dutch anti-Islam party to have strong voice in next govt	"Dutch anti-Islam party to have strong voice in next govt(AFP) Ã¢ € “ 8 hours agoTHE HAGUE Ã¢ € ” Dutch anti-Islam MP Geert Wilders will have to be consulted on every decision the next government makes if a provisional agreement on forming a new cabinet reached Friday is finalised, an expert said.Under the provisional agreement, Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) will have no cabinet members but would have a crucial ""support"" role, the centre-right VVD, the Christian Democratic Action (CDA) and the free-market PVV said in a joint statement.An analyst told AFP the agreement would in fact mean Wilders having a strong voice in government decisions as he would have to be consulted on each issue.Talks on forming a new cabinet ended late Friday with further discussions scheduled to firm up the accord from next week.Although he will not be in the cabinet, Wilders is in a strong bargaining position after the PVV made the biggest gains in June 9 elections -- coming third by raising its number of seats from nine to 24 out of 150 in the Dutch parliament.The VVD won with 31 seats, while fellow rightists CDA came in fourth with 21 seats -- half its previous total.Negotiations to form a coalition involving the VVD and the second biggest party, the labour PvdA with 30 seats, failed over disagreements on economic policy.Maverick Wilders has earned notoriety around the world with his campaign to ""stop the Islamisation of the Netherlands.""He calls Islam a fascist religion, campaigns for the banning of the Koran and the burqa, and likens the Koran to Hitler's ""Mein Kampf."" He is known abroad for his 17-minute commentary, ""Fitna"", which was termed ""offensively anti-Islamic"" by UN chief Ban Ki-moon.He was barred from entering Britain last year to stop him spreading ""hatred and violent messages.""Copyright Ã‚ © 2010 AFP.

SOCL	End of Days in May? Believers enter final stretch	"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/40885541/1/3/11'A lot of people might think, 'The end's coming, let's go party.' But we're commanded by God to warn people'RALEIGH, N.C. Ã¢ € ” If there had been time, Marie Exley would have liked to start a family. Instead, the 32-year-old Army veteran has less than six months left, which she'll spend spreading a stark warning: Judgment Day is almost here.Exley is part of a movement of Christians loosely organized by radio broadcasts and websites, independent of churches and convinced by their reading of the Bible that the end of the world will begin on May 21, 2011.To get the word out, they're using billboards and bus stop benches, traveling caravans of RVs and volunteers passing out pamphlets on street corners. Cities from Bridgeport, Conn., to Little Rock, Ark., now have billboards with the ominous message, and mission groups are traveling in countries from Latin America to Africa to spread the news outside the U.S.More U.S. news    Airports toy with the idea of tossing the TSAUpdated 31 minutes ago 1/3/2011 8:24:41 PM +00:00 Full-body scanners and enhanced pat-downs have spurred a loud outcry from an angry public,    and some airports are considering moving the TSA out and private contractors in.

""But we're commanded by God to warn people. I wish I could just be like everybody else, but it's so much better to know that when the end comes, you'll be safe.""In August, Exley left her home in Colorado Springs, Colo., to work with Oakland, Calif.-based Family Radio Worldwide, the independent Christian ministry whose leader, Harold Camping, has calculated the May 21 date based on his reading of the Bible.She is organizing traveling columns of RVs carrying the message from city to city, a logistics challenge that her military experience has helped solve. The vehicles are scheduled to be in five North Carolina cities between now and the second week of January, but Exley will shortly be gone: overseas, where she hopes to eventually make it back to Iraq.""I don't really have plans to come back,"" she said. ""Time is short.""advertisement | ad infoAdvertisement | ad infoAdvertisement | ad info.'Definitely against the grain'Not everyone who's heard Camping's message is taking such a dramatic step. They're remaining in their day-to-day lives, but helping publicize the prophecy in other ways. Allison Warden, of Raleigh, has been helping organize a campaign using billboards, postcards and other media in cities across the U.S. through a website, We Can Know.The 29-year-old payroll clerk laughs when asked about reactions to the message, which is plastered all over her car.""It's definitely against the grain, I know that,"" she said. ""We're hoping people won't take our word for it, or Harold Camping's word for it. We're hoping that people will search the scriptures for themselves.""Camping, 89, believes the Bible essentially functions as a cosmic calendar explaining exactly when various prophecies will be fulfilled.Only on msnbc.com Home prices are down, so why not insurance?Creationists' theme park seeks tax breakThe GOP's key players going into 2012Looking for a job in 2011? HereÃ¢ € ™s how to stand outBest bets: The Visitors of 'V' returnDoes Mona LisaÃ¢ € ™s gaze hold clues to painting?..The retired civil engineer said all his calculations come from close readings of the Bible, but that external events like the foundation of the state of Israel in 1948 are signs confirming the date.""Beyond the shadow of a doubt, May 21 will be the date of the Rapture and the day of judgment,"" he said.The doctrine known as the Rapture teaches that believers will be taken up to heaven, while everyone else will remain on earth for a period of torment, concluding with the end of time. Camping believes that will happen in October.""If May 21 passes and I'm still here, that means I wasn't saved. Does that mean God's word is inaccurate or untrue? Not at all,"" Warden said.Great DisappointmentThe belief that Christ will return to earth and bring an end to history has been a basic element of Christian belief since the first century. The Book of Revelation, which comes last in the New Testament, describes this conclusion in vivid language that has inspired Christians for centuries.But few churches are willing to set a date for the end of the world, heeding Jesus' words in the gospels of Mark and Matthew that no one can know the day or hour it will happen. Predictions like Camping's, though, aren't new. One of the most famous in history was by the Baptist leader William Miller, who predicted the end for Oct. 22, 1844, which came to be known as the Great Disappointment among his followers, some of who subsequently founded the Seventh Day Adventist church.""In the U.S., there is still a significant population, mostly Protestant, who look at the Bible as kind of a puzzle, and the puzzle is God's word and it's predicting when the end times will come,"" said Catherine Wessinger, a professor at Loyola University in New Orleans who studies millennialism, the belief in pending apocalypse.""A lot of times these prophecies gain traction when difficulties are happening in society,"" she said. ""Right now, there's a lot of insecurity, and this is a promise that says it's not all random, it's part of God's plan.""advertisement | ad infoAdvertisement | ad infoAdvertisement | ad info.Past predictions that failed to come true don't have any bearing on the current calculation, believers maintain.""It would be like telling the Wright Brothers that every other attempt to fly has failed, so you shouldn't even try,"" said Chris McCann, who works with eBible Fellowship, one of the groups spreading the message.For believers like McCann, theirs is actually a message of hope and compassion: God's compassion for people, and the hope that there's still time to be saved.That, ultimately, is what spurs on Exley, who said her beliefs have alienated her from most of her friends and family. Her hope is that not everyone who hears her message will mock it, and that even people who dismiss her now might still come to believe.""If you still want to say we're crazy, go ahead,"" she said. ""But it doesn't hurt to look into it.""Copyright 2011 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed."

SOCL	Unknown genetic diseas	Hello! I'm writing from Estonia. My aunts husband has some kind of genetic disease. His parents are normal, but he and his sister are both sick. He also has a daughter with the same disease. I also added a picture of him. The symptoms of this diseas are: short legs and stocky torso and ankles have a small absence of motion. The daugter is also quite heavy if to consider that she is only a child. And it is difficult for her to do sports like skiing and running.    They haven't got any help from estonian doctors and this disease is also the reason why they can't have a child. It would be very likely that their child will have the same disease.Can you tell what kind of disease this is and could it be prevented before a child is born?
SOCL	Normal sexuality	"Before my question I need to clarify something. I have been with my wife for 20 years. My question is very personal. She will not let me complete, or even start to have regular intercourse before she starts performing oral sex on me. If I attempt to stop her she basically insists on continuing until I climax. Then she's satisfied. I'm not. I've talked to her about it to no avail. I've even begged her for just intercourse. Before I get a short way into intercourse she says she wants to ""just kiss it"". Then she is disappointed if I don't climax while she does this. That's all she wants. I want more than that.Question: Is she as abnormal as I'm thinking she may be?"
FAML	My 8 year old cries over tests	My son's school/class has started preparing for their CRCT test.    Students must pass this test to move on to the 4th grade.    My son is terrified of the word test.    If he hears the word he begins to cry incontrollably.    This has become such an issue, his teacher has called concerned about it.    What do I do?    I can't say anything to him that reassures him that he's going to pass the 3rd grade.
SOCL	A year and still no answers.	Doctor,I've suffered with depression and anxiety for years.    Although, just recently, I've started Prozac (still too early to tell of my progress).    However, the past year, I've also picked up another wonder mental disorder - Hypochondria (makes sense, doesn't it?).    It started with a bad bruise and migraines combined with Depersonalization.    Eventually, the migraines stopped and thankfully, the Depersonalization went away after a few weeks.    I mistakenly googled illness that matched my symptoms and came across HIV.    Talk about the worst 6+ months of my life!    I KNEW I had it.    But 2 tests later (one at 4 months and one at 6 months), I was proved wrong.    Although, I still have those days where I just KNOW I have it.    Since then, I've had various episodes of a sore throat.    It started with Tonsillitis (something I've never had before).    I have large tonsils to begin with.    But since I've gotten Tonsillitis, I've had a sore throat on and off.    It's usually like once a month.    I've always had unusual bowel movements (I hardly ever go).    But recently, it's been kind of crazy.    I've also dealt with a lot of nausea and loss of appetite.    I haven't lost any weight, though I've admittedly gained a few pounds.    Some days are better though.    I had a very bad yeast infection from the antibiotics and I went through a month phase of thinking I had herpes.    Negative blood test and negative culture tests.    I've been tested for all STDs and it is all negative (multiple times).    I've had two CBCs done and all normal.    My pap smears are also normal.    I have had ultrasounds done and a sonohystogram done.    All normal.    I'm recently thought my broken tooth was the cause of it all.    I thought I had an infected tooth and it was causing me problems.    I'm getting surgery on Monday to remove the tooth, as well as my wisdom teeth.    But, the doctor said I didn't have a tooth abscess.I'm so confused.    What is with the recurring sore throat?    What's with my crazy stomach and bowel issues?    Any more tests you'd recommend?    I'm ready to leave this part of my life.    I've been playing the guessing came for a year now and no doctor is that helpful.
SOCL	pimples	An essays is usually a short piece of writing which is often written from an author's personal point of view. Essays can consist of a number of elements, including: literary criticism, political manifestos, learned arguments, observations of daily life, recollections, and reflections of the author. The definition of an essay is vague, overlapping with those of an article and a short story. Almost all modern essays are written in prose, but works in verse have been dubbed essays
FAML	Night terrors??	I posted this a month ago and no one responded. It's still happening and need advice! Thanks!!My two year old has been acting strangely while asleep and it's scaring me! Just two nights ago, I heard sounds coming from his room. It sounded like he was talking, so I went in there to see what he was doing and he was asleep, but he looked awake. He was giggling and laughing and I honestly thought he was awake, but he wasn't! I even picked him up and held him for a minute, gave him kisses and laid him back down and that is when he freaked out. He woke up, and was completely trembling. It was like he didn't know where he was, or who I was. This is not the first time this has happened, but other times, he has screamed out in the middle of the night. I even found him on top of a dresser in his room one night and when I went to put him back in bed, he woke up and started freaking out. These are just two examples of this, it has been going on for a while and in different forms. Anyone have any idea what this is?? Thank you!

FAML	Strange thoughts-Repetitive Questions	Hello,Over the last few months, I've noticed a progression of odd behavior from my 8yr old daughter.    It started awhile back with questions about whether I loved her more or my husband more (remarried 2.5yrs ago), and she would also ask her dad that question about her or his new wife.    Another thing she started doing was putting things in lists, whether it be friends, toys, movies, etc.    Which one she liked first, then 2nd, 3rd so on.    She also repeats statements and questions two or more times.    The latest thing is that she has started saying that she feels like she likes someone better than me but she actually likes me better.    This has been family, friends and even people she sees on tv.    She has also said she feels like I'm stupid for doing a particular thing, but she knows I'm not stupid.    She tells me these different things several times a day.    The only time she isn't talking about these things is if she is distracted by other activities.    These last two things are making her very distraught.    She is saying that she doesn't want to think these thoughts but she can't help it.    I don't know what to do.    One of us is going to go crazy if I don't figure out how to solve this!Any advice??Thanks!

I had doubts of attention related issues and had explored this, but priliminary evaluations indicate she is fine and does not have a attention deficit problem and she simply might not be intrested in following guidelines. This is affecting her schooling and she belongs to the ""do not listen"" category. For she to be remotely successful, she has to be able to follow directions.

PREG	HELP IUI question - all feedback welcomed	Hi all, I am new to this community so let me introduce myself. I am 27, DH is 27, we are unable to conceive naturally after 3 years of trying (hubby doesn't produce germ cells) we decided to go with a donor. I have had 3 MC before DH and my HSG revealed a blocked fallopian tube (right). Currently using the clearblue easy fertility monitor. I had my first IUI on my second cycle of clomid 50mg on the 19th and am currently 4dpiui. The first cycle did not give me an egg symbol. My cycle averages between 32-34 days and I O really late (day20).The weird thing is two days after I felt a pulling/sticking sensation in my lower abd as if someone was sticking me with a needle. It was very uncomfortable, and stopped on yesterday. I have never had that feeling before...EVER now I am cramping slightly, frequent urination, some light-headed feeling and bloated. I am wondering if this will give me my BFP. What do ya'll think? I can test on the 1st since AF is due on the 30th. Has anyone ever experienced this? Don't wanna get my hopes up but this is weird and I need answers.
TRMT	Full Sized Breast in Armpit	"Doctor, I have followed with interest many comments on the issue of Accessory Breast in the Armpit for more than a year. I have never seen a picture or heard of anyone that has the size of what is under my right armpit. It took a lot of courage to finally write this. It is not a ""tissue"" - it is a full breast with no nipple protruding. More than a handful if you tried to clasp. It has grown over a 10 - 11 years period. Size kept increasing after my two kids. I was scared and still am scared what I will be told if I saw a doctor. It does not hurt at all. Occasionally    (once every two/three months) I feel some sharp pain but in the right breast not in the accessory. Recently, in the last 6 months, I also noticed a lump in the left armpit too - almost the size of a tennis ball. Neither of them hurt. I do not consider these a ""cosmetic issue"", I have only chosen to live with them silently out of fear that removing them might lead to complications or my pictures may be splattered over medical journals....but now I am also worried should they become malignant. I am about 5ft 8' and 200lbs. Overweight but not fat. About 3 doctors who took a cursory look in the past claimed it was ancillary breast tissue and the little bumps I feel inside were nipples. But each time I touch both they feel lumpy. What do I do? Sorry for long post...can no longer be silent. Thanks.This discussion is related toAccessory Breast Tissue."

Now I am having pains all over my body like it feels like a bee bites me, but nothign there.    The crawling sensation is still there off/on.    Sometimes it feels like my hands/legs feels like numb.    I have been seeing alot of red like dots like a red pen inked on me all over my body but dr said probably broked vessels its hereditary.    I went to dr .    I had previously been on B6 100 mg for abuot 3 weeks becuase i was told by my urologist this may help prevent more kidney stones. I went off those becuase i felt like it was keeping me up to much.    The dr said that she thought it could be like w/d symptoms from the b6 or it could be another type of deficiency but did not think bugs at all.    It came back I have iron deficency but no anemia and my b6 levels were normal but low normal.She put me on ferrous sulfate for a month and back on b6 pills 50 mg. I was wondering do these symptoms sound like they coudl be becuase of a iron deficeny or b6 low level?    If so how long should it take with these pills for these symptoms to go away?    Or what else coudl it be.    Its driving me nuts.    I use free/clear laudry soap.Thanks!
TRMT	PLEASE HELP............Problems after abdominal Hysterectomy!!!!	"Is it possible????    I had a Hysterectomy and after surgery I could not move my bowels for at least 3 weeks!!    The doctor told me that sometimes our organs don't wake up right away after surgery.    Well it became worst as weeks and months went on.    I was rushed to the hospital 4 months after surgery, I was having a difficult time breathing.    I was admitted and test were done.    I was backed up with poop, and had to have an enema, which really did not do much.    I then was instructed to drink a gallon of some stuff (that they prep you with to have a colonoscopy).    That was a nightmare, as I was drinking this, I became very bloated and nausea.    It took, 15 hours before I could move my bowels.    A total of 2 days drinking and pooping and I still was not cleared out!!    Still having trouble moving my bowels, sometimes days before I could go and then a week.    I called a gastro doc and he set up a colonoscopy.    I had to prep 2 days before the procedure.    The morning of the procedure I still was NOT cleaned out!!!!    YUCK.......still had to have the test.    Now come to find out i have COLONIC INTERIA, but NEVER had problems before the hysterectomy.    I have also been having problems with my left leg (nerve) and 2 small toes going a little numb on me................but again NEVER had this until the hysterectomy!!!!I am a very active person, previously had 3 c-sections and when I was just 10years old I had to have my right ovary and tube out........due to a cyst that had twisted my ovary.    I have also had 2-3 laporoscopy's.    I know I had ALOT of scar tissue, but when the gatro doc had gone in he said and put it on his report, ""colon features a sigmoid that is sharply angulated"".............only on the left side.    Well when I had the hysterectomy all I had left was the whole left side(ovary & tube).    Is anyone else experiencing these problems.    I have NEVER gone to a doctor for being CONSTIPATED until I had the hysterectomy!!!!    Is it possible they might have damaged muscle and nerve and the left side of my colon when they performed the hysterectomy????"

FAML	out of control	"My 6 year old step-daughter has been without her mother for the last couple of years, she just upped and left her to her father. I have been apart of her life for 4 years now and have been in a relationship with her father for 2. She was a very smart and independent child before being removed from the home by facs when she was 3 because of her mother. We have won our custody battle and she has been home with us for 9 months now. Speaking with her foster mom I find that my boyfriend and I are having the same problems the foster mom was having with her.She is constantly mouthing off to everybody, she would rather play alone than with anybody else, she gets very physical with objects that are around her when she doesn't get her way. Just last week she had a spelling test and she didn't ""feel like it"" so she took her shoes off and began to throw them around the classroom. She is peeing and pooping her pants on a daily basis sometimes 4-5 times a day. Last week as well, she got up at 3:00am and sat in the middle of her floor, we told her that she needed to be in her bed because she had school in the morning and she needed her rest so that she could be awake to play the next day. She refused. Her father had to scoop her up off the floor and put her in her bed and even getting her head down on the pillow was a hassle. She woke her 1 year old sister up in the process. Although she has yet to harm her younger sister in a huge manor, I am afraid that she may or even hurt herself. The foster mom had told us that she used to have to hold her down because she would get so violent. She has and still is in psychiatry and play theory but nobody seems to have an answer other than anxiety. To me this seems to be more than anxiety. There is a history of bi-polar in her family and they are looking out for it but they say that it is very highly unlikely. I have mentioned to them ODD and they gave me no response to this, they just changed the subject. She's not eating her meals, so I make sure to give her a vitamin every day so that she still gets the nutrition she needs. I have tried every discipline in the book. I have had facs, public health, and councilors give me advice and I've taken it but none of it is working. As for her peeing and pooping herself I have also taken her to the doctors for that to see if it was a medical problem and the results came back negative.It seems to me too that she likes to cause problems. The way that I explained it to her psychiatrist is that she has just lit a village on fire and she's sitting at the highest hilltop and watching everybody run for their lives. I saw one day that her father and I had got into an argument about how to deal with this situation and she sat on the couch, watching us, with a smile on her face. To me this seems defiant. It's almost like she's purposely trying to cause problems or maybe she's just trying to pry her father and I apart. Whatever the case may be, something has to give.My patience is wearing thin and I try to be considerate of her situation but I can only be considerate so much before she takes advantage of it. I don't really know what to do and I think I could better cope and communicate with her better if I could find out what the problem is, whether it's medical or behavioural. What's your opinion on ODD? What's your opinion on the matter?"

I was just wondering, is it possible that i am bringing them on myself by thinking about having palpitations all the time? I had some yesterday after about a week free of them, then today as soon as i woke up i was thinking if i would have another one. Ive just had one! They make me so anxious. I know they cant hurt me but the feeling is horrible, frightening, and i feel sick etc. I am also waiting to have CBT to help me, will this help?Thank youSherriexx

FAML	gender identity	My granddaughter was sexually molested as a very young child, she is 15 and is showing signs of gay behavior she has always been a tomboy but I see her struggling with her sexual identity, she was dressing with girl tops for a short time but now has changed to wearing all large men tee shirts. As she started to develop she would always wear double tee shirts. she is also hanging around girls that are gay. My question is could this be a result from her being molested as a child or is gay a choice?From a Concerned Grandmother
FAML	drug addicted infant and odd behavior	I adopted my foster son when he was almost 2 yo.    he was born addicted to cocaine and tested + for marajuana.    He is 4 now and is just about to dx with ADHD and ODD.    He has global developmental delays and his behavior is very exhausting.    He will be receiving inhome support and will be transfering from his developmental preschool to a behavioral preschool soon where he will receive more therapy.    In the mean time, what can we do at home to try to help his behavior?    He refuses to use the potty ( and he can) and leaves poopy diapers all over the house.    I feel like I am constantly on a poopy diaper scavenger hunt.    Time outs are a joke to him and his fake screaming/ crying are getting really hard to ignore.    Any suggestions?    Foster parent training hasn't addressed this issue to my knowledge.
FAML	Is this normal?	"My little guy that is going to be 5 in a ouple of days, has a major aditude problem. If I get after him for something, he come right back in a snitty voice and repeats what I say. He also is very hateful towards me, I know he's a daddies boy but there are days I can't even look at him, and others I'm his best friend. We also have problems in the morning getting ready for school, it's like we are walking on eggshells until we know if he wakes up on the ""right side "" of the bed. It's all so confusing, is it normal or do I have something to worry about?"
DISE	What would you do when in my shoes: swolen ankles, no diagnosis	"hi, allsome of you know me already. I am the guy with symptoms without diagnosis. Sigh, my story is so wicket, i sometimes get desperate.In 2002 i had risky contact with IV using girl, and some weeks after that had elevated ALT, AST (100-200) for several months. Retrospectively diagnosed as ""undefined self limited hepatitis"". But for me it's clear it cannot be just some co-incidence.And now i find myself in the most difficult situation i ever was in:- i have lots of strange symptoms: (diagnosed!) palmar erythema, strange swolen feeling/pain around ankles/feet), occasional itching.- the swelling around ankles is still relatively moderate (perhaps 2-3 mm), but i feel they are swolen, and they hurt 24h / day.- have elevated bilirubin ~1-1.5 mg/dl (but mainly indirect one), so docs think it is harmless (Gilbert's syndrome)- elevated bile acids (~20mmol, range    But here the strange thing:- all viral tests negative (Hep ABCDE, HIV etc), by antibody, DNA, antigen etc. in serum (and PBMCs)- two normal liver biopsies: 09/2007 and 03/2008. They say, zero inflammation, zero fibrosis, etc.- except bili, all liver params (ALT, AST, GammaGT, Alk.Ph, etc.) ""normal"" (betwen 10-30), except for inverted AST:ALT ratio (but docs say this does not matter)- normal ultrasound + duplex (repeated)- normal fibroscan (around 5kpa or so)- no varices found in stomach, esophagus (i thought it would indirectly show i have liver problem, but glad nothing was found)- i had some 'swolen lymph nodes' but they turned out to be lipoms (fat deposit) after extraction and analyzis by pathologist.i hope it's not seen as cynical to put my proud stage0/grade0 results and negative tests on the board where many people are confronted with very, very different results. But pls. understand, i am really suffering and would do anything for a cure or at least improvement of my situation. So i am thankful for any kind of input. And the question for me is: if it's not the liver, what else??? What kind of doctor should i see? would an Endocrinologist make sense?Here are my compiled doctor reports:http://www.hotlinkfiles.com/files/1162323_slixs/anamnesis_en_mar26.pdfJoachim"
FAML	4 Year Old Behavior-Wants to Control	My grandaughter is 4 and very smart.    It seems that she can be sweet part of the time and then can just fly off the handle.    My son and his wife have tried different types of discipline, but are at their wits end.    She seems to direct her crying and hitting more at her mom who has become depressed over the situation.    And she knows that she has been bad.    I have noticed when asked for hugs and kisses when we say good bye that she very seldom gives us one and it is not just us.    She has a 4 year old cousin who is small for his age and she can play nice with him, but at times will act more like a mother to him.    This has been going on for about the past year.    Any suggestions would greatly be appreciated.

It's not much but it's in the right direction - down!    I have a very long way to go and have decided it will need to be a life time change and that's okay!    I also decided to start swimming *yikes!* and rediscovered a love of swimming!    It was scary to think of me in a bathing suit (and wearing it in public!!) but I got over it (no one sees you in the pool anyway).    I'm looking forward to each new week of my new life!    I've had ups and downs with the scale over the last six months but have realized it works if you work it!    Looking forward to ""talking"" with others and learning new tips, suggestions and support in our journey to lose weight and become healthy!Debbie"

DISE	Up-to-date Procedures for RAI Scan	I came here looking for answers regarding the RAI scan I just had done and I'm leaving with only more questions. I went to the health pages, and it appears that the procedure there follows what I had done 7 years ago. According to my doctor, this is no longer the procedure. I was given Thyrogen shots so that I would not have to go without my medication. I continued my normal, daily routine. I didn't have to go on a low iodine diet, either. I was researching because I found conflicting stories on whether you could eat beforehand or not, since I was not told that I couldn't; I was concerned that this could effect the outcome. Has anyone else had an RAI scan done, recently?
PREG	Help me with my ultrasound...boy or girl?	Hi everyone.    I had an ultrasound last week at about 19.5 weeks and decided not to find out gender of the baby.    Now my curiosity has gotten the best of me and I find myself scrutinizing some of the pics from the dvd we brought home.    What do you all think?    The black and white ones are where the baby has it's knees pulled up.    The other split screen is a 3D from the backside and what I believe is the same pic just an inside view. (This was the picture that captured my interest as I thought something looked fairly obvious!)    Opinions? Boy or Girl?Thanks!

SOCL	Dark veins on the shaft of penis	Hello. I did a hanging job on my penis last night with 2.2 lbs for 40 minutes with 2 breaks. During the last minutes I noticed a sharp pain on the hanging area. After ending the session I couldn't even touch my penis due to pain. In the morning after waking up I noticed the left area on the shaft under the head several small dark veins have appeared which I never saw before & it is still causing a lot of pain when touched. I can have erections normally, but the pain is uncomfortable. What can I do in this case?
SOCL	PLEASE HELP	HI, my son (4 years old)    has been coughing for a very long time with no answers from his doctors.    His first xray in November of 2007 showed Atalectasis.    Docs sent him home saying he had Croup and that atalectasis would clear up.    Still coughing all these months, new pediatrician was diagnosed with Asthma in December. His asthma is also exercise induced. Saw pulmonologist and gave him Flow Vent and Albuterol inhalers , along with Decadron when the flare ups occurred and Croup.    Saw another new doctor because son was not getting better.    Same peds office new doctor but was really ill...lots of phlegm etc, she gave him a Zpak + nebulizer with Albuterol solution.    We did that nothing changed.    Sent him for second xray, which showed atalectasis and pneumonia altho the report didnt say any pneumonia, just atalectasis.    Treated him with 10 days Augmentin and Pedia Pred.    Cough cleared up, No sickness either.    6 days after antibiotics , breathing tx's and pedia pred finished, cough returns with fever.    Had chest CT and doc says Atalectasis caused by Asthma.    (I dont have this report in hand but will have exact report then).    Could this be RMLS?    Oh also this doctor while she was treating my son with this last treatement also thinks my son has PRADER WILLI syndrome.    My son is 87lbs and 4 feet tall...but he is only 4 years old.    He was born a preemie by c-section.    He was 36 weeks when he was born.    Anyway I asked what that was and she told me to Google it that her partner came up with it.    I am dealing with not so very good health care where I live and am probably going to head to Seattle for the Childrens' hospital there if I can find a decent pulmonologist.    I am N. West Montana.    I do however also have family in Chicago and can travel there as well if anyone knows of a children's pulmonologist there.    My issues are I am not getting anything in concrete here. I am getting partial diagnosis of asthma,    If my child has asthma, why wasnt he returned to the original meds of Flow Vent medications after the    pneumonia cleared?    He was taking Flow Vent 2 x a day and Albuterol inhaler 4x a day during a flare up. The kicker in all this is it all started in July of 2007 after a bout of Croup.    He recovered from that but after that every time he got a cold he would cough till he vomited.    And in November he was never able to recover from it.    He literally coughed from November till March.    Everytime the coughs would get bad is when he would vomit.    He actually figured out a way to cough without it hurting him so much.    He was given Tylenol w/codeine to stop the spasming on several occasions.    I am so frustrated.    I am in the process of searching for a pulmonologist.    IF anyone can shed any kind of light on this subject I would be so grateful.    I feel I have been shuffled around with no one really knowing what is going on with my son and I hope that we dont have any kind of permanent damage being mis diagnosed with any of this.    If anyone would like further info because you might have an answer for me please email me at ***@****.    PLEASE HELP THIS FRUSTRATED MOM IN GETTING SOME ANSWERS.

DISE	Can You Give me some Help	I have had my symptoms for 8yrs now. have seen several Doctors and yet to come up with a proper diagnosis. I have severe pain that runs through the central nervous system of my body. It never affects the same area each time I have an outbreak of a rash. Although over the 8 yrs. it has been in the same place more than once. First I have severe pain either in my head or leg or shoulders or arms or hand or ankle. Then 2to 3 days a rash appears either across my tail bone in a horse shoe shape with swelling and inflamation(inflammation), or on my wrist,face,knee area,or head and neck. It used to run with my mensus cycle so I hoped and prayed after menopause it would go away. I am now 2 yrs. post and still having all the pain and symptoms. I have been told spider bite on my first diagnosis. Then Shingles,then fibromyalgia,then one Dr. told me I was crazy in so many words. I went to see a specialist in chronic disease and he ran blood tests and to no avail. I'm really weary from the pain and the outbreaks.
PREG	any advice for a 3 time miscarrage(miscarriage)?	I just had my third miscarrage(miscarriage)2 weeks ago--and this is by far the hardest-- we went to a fertility center and used an egg donor.    The egg donor was pre 30's,and I still miscarried @ 6 weeks.    The fertility center we used has won many awards.    I had a d+c last week and we sent the baby to a genetic lab to determine what went wrong.    I know the only way we'll have a family is to keep trying, but what if I am defective?    There is    a saying- the third time is the charm-- in my case the third time we used a nationaly renowed fertility center- inserted    2 egg donar eggs less than 30 yrs old- only 1 attached, and then died at 6 weeks!!!!We are waiting for results of the genetic testing, but I can't help feeling this is my fault.    The only way for me to get pregnant is to keep going up this crazy expensive heart-renching hill.

For context, I'm 45years old, male, a thyroid (papillary cancer) survivor, and extremely healthy/fit... and I've had no prior history of headaches or tinnitus or dizziness.

Normal enhancement of the major dural venous sinuses.Mild potentially chronic multifocal paranasal sinus mucosal thickening, ethmoid and maxillary sinuses are most notably involved.    No acute mastoid fluid collections.

Mike Castle in the GOP primary -- who was believed to have the best shot at winning in the general election -- only to then lose to Democrat Chris Coons.But O'Donnell wants another run.According to Delaware Online, O'Donnell is considering a rematch with Coons, now the state's junior senator, when he is up for reelection in 2014.""I think I owe that to my supporters, to at least consider a run,Ã¢ €  O'Donnell said in an interview last week.

PREG	OTC Natural Progesterone Cream/Luteal Phase	I've been BBT charting for 5 months now. From that, I have been able to determine that I have a short luteal phase. (never more than 10/11 days) During my LP, my temps also start dropping by about dpo5/6. This cycle, I started taking a B6-12 vitamin. I ovulated on CD22, and also started using a otc progesterone cream 1/8 tsp/2x daily. within a couple of days, my breasts and nipples became very sore and tender. I also started feeling extremely tired, and was urinating frequently. I had frequent headaches and at times felt dizzy. My temps rose and I am now at dpo11. My temps have remained elevated and above my coverline, though they started to go down slightly today. I did a pregnancy test today, because today would have been the day my period would have come, and it came back negative. Also, my breasts are not as tender today. Is this normal using a progesterone cream? Can it mimic symptoms of pregnancy? Was today too early to test for pregnancy? At the dosage that I am taking of the progesterone cream, will my period come on it's own, or should I stop taking the cream by a certain time period?
DISE	Sleeplessness	My husband has fusions from S1 to L4 and nerve damage in his spine from the injury and stenosis. He has been on a variety of meds - none of which he has been able to take for any length of time - and now is back on motrin and hydrocodone as it is summer and the pain abates this time of year. The problem is he cannot sleep more than 3 hrs a night. He has lunesta but if he takes it more than once a week it does not work. He has tried ambien and rosearum. Any ideas of older sleeping meds that might work? Or anything that might work? He complains that his knees and hips hurt terribly at night no matter how he lays and this keeps him awake. Pain meds at night are out of the question as they do not sedate him but wire him up.

TRMT	Side effects during Vitamin D recovery subsides with Calcium	I'm taking 50,000IU vitamin D3 per week because of my low Vitamin D level.Within a few days, the following symptoms developed:- Extreme thirst that won't go away with fluid- Fast heart rate (I could hear hear beating in my ears whole time)- Muscle tightness- Extreme fatigue (could sleep 24hr if I wanted)- Increase in appetite (found this to be good since I've always been underweight and not much appetite)So, I did some research and read that these symptoms are caused by Magnesium deficiency.    So, I tried high doses of magnesium with Vitamin D for a few days and it did not help a bit (even tried topical magnesium oil which is known for best absorption).I also read that these symptoms are caused by high calcium in blood.BUT, I wanted to try 500mg of calcium just before I give a rest to the recovery due to the extremely uncomfortable symptoms. And within a few hours of taking calcium those symptoms disappear, and I get great energy that I have never felt before.Can someone explain why this happens? I thought all those symptoms are from high calcium in blood so I was supposed to avoid calcium and take magnesium instead????? So confused......
DEMO	plan B Confusion	Hi... I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend on the 2nd of December. He definitely pulled out, but seeing as that's not the most effetive method, I took Plan B on the 4th (about 40 hours later). Anyway, I started brown spotting on the afternoon of the 8th. About 8 hours later, it picked up into a full flow. I thought this was an early period but it only lasted for 2 days. (My periods usually last about 4). Anyway, I'm now 2-3 days late. What should I be thinking at this point? Thanks..

DISE	Update on butterflytc	Hi, butterfly has asked that i come in and fill you in on what has been going on. She tried to make an open journal but it is not showing up. If you can get to het profile, you should be able to read it. she has had a lot of problems with her profile since she decided to take a break, so in case you cannot get there I will fill you in.She had her last GI test and they have decided to go in and do a double intestional bypass surgey with a possible colestomy. They will not know until they get tn there. But she is unable to eat or drink and they are worried about her starving to death. Her surgery is scheduled for Oct 14 which is next week. I will be going up there the day that she gets home as someone will need to be there with her. Shamus (her boyfriend) will be there but he has been so terribly worried and they have both decided that they would feel better if I was there with her. So the day she comes home, I will be heading to Chicago.I will be making sure that this is ok with my Dr and I need to make sure this awful cold that I have is gone by then.Please say a prayer for her that things will be just fine.Love Chris
PREG	faint positive hpt with light bleeding	We have been ttc for 12 months and had an early pregnancy loss at 18 dpo 2 months ago. Last cycle, i decided to start Clomid as though i seem to ovulate reguarly, my doctor thinks that it's too late, usually around day 19.    So i started 25mg of Clomid on days 5-9 and i o'd on day 16 which was great.    Today i got a faint + on hpt which is 14 dpo.    As what happened last time though, i have been spotting for 3 days and it got heavier overnight.    This is such a confusing time and i feel like i am on an emotional roller coaster.    Has anyone been through something similar and do they have any advice for how to deal with the worry of miscarriage?

TRMT	Split cord? Would like to hear your opinion.	Hello,First of all, thank you for your time.I've recently been diagnosed with spina bifida occulta in my lumbar spine, accompanied by split cord there aswell.I also have a low lying conus medullaris due to a tiny bit of fat tissue connected to it at sacral level.I also had a congenital inclusion dermoid cyst in the back of my head (occipital region), which has been successfully removed when I was 2 years old. I'm 20 now.I've recently had a check-up mri of my head to see if the cyst had come back, but it hadn't.But I saw something else on the mri, which got me worrying a bit.It's about my cervical spinal cord, it looks as if it's going to split there aswell. The mri only shows a part of my cervical spinal cord, since it's an mri of my head. But it certainly makes it look as if it's about to split completely, since the posterior side of the spinal cord is already showing a split, which isn't normal I assume?I really think the posterior 'split' of the cervical spinal cord is there, and isn't due to me moving or something, because it shows in more than one series (with contrast, without contrast, coronal and transverse series).I don't have any symptoms in my hands or arms though (yet). Well, the 2 smallest fingers of my right hand are a little smaller than they should be, they also look a tiny bit webbed, but no neurological symptoms.Only the split cord of my lumbar spine is causing some -minor- neurological symptoms in my right foot and leg.Could you please take a look at the photos I added, and tell me your opinion?Should I have an mri done of my cervical spine? Please let me know what you think.Thank you for your timeBlonmp

GOAL	Red Swollen Eye, No Pain, Protien Buildup	Ive had alot of eye problems ever since I first started wearing contacts.. Ive had Ulcers, tons of pink eye, and even a cut or two on my eyes. But my doctor always took care of them well before he retired, and when it happened it was always few and far between. A while back after my eye doctor retired my right eye lids had started swelling. I thought oh no biggie its spring I get allergies and sinus probs etc... but it never stopped swelling.. after about a 4 weeks my eye was swollen so big and it had become so red it look like I had been punched in the eye socket without getting bruised. So typically I go to the emergency room thinking this is WAY different than the normal pink eye or ulcers.. and it wasnt even painful which was my other concern.After like a nice 5 hour wait im told I have pink eye. they didnt swab my eye, do tests or anything.. they only made me read a board across the room without my glasses on. Well I was very unsure of the answer they gave me but went home took the meds they gave me and nothing worked. After about 4 months the swelling stopped. My eye went back to normal, and I was able to wear contacts again. So I get a new doctor, new perscription.. turns out that eye sees even better than my last checkup 2 years ago.Well now it has started swelling again.. and Im pretty sure its not because I dont ake care of my eyes.. because after a painful ulcer like the ones ive had I am EXTRA EXTRA careful with my contacts. So now on top of swelling its producing a ton of protien buildup in my eyelids and on my eyelashes especially when I wake up.. I cant even open my eye some days because its sealed shut. What am I going to do? I know this cant be pink eye.. theres no way it could last this long and not at least effect the other eye or be somewhat painful. I need some advice.. anyone have ANY earthly ideas what it could possibly be?

DISE	Who should test for hep b in my situation	I'm new to the hep b forum, as I am a hep c'er.    My 18 year old daughter was diagnosed with hep c.. We just got her blood work back. All the counts were fine, ALT 23. But there was something I found very curious. She had Hep B antibodies, but no virus, meaning she cleared the virus herself. My GP said it was very common in children born and grown up in Asia. She was born in Indonesia and we left for Europe, when she was 8. We never knew she had it, as she had never had any jaundice. I read up a bit on this, and it seems that many children in that part of the world, get infected by playing with each other. The run around outside, fall, bleed, etc. Body contact is much more common in Indonesia. (I myself am hep b negative, with no antibodies)My question is, do I need to have my other children (17 - 24) also tested for hep b?    Nobody is ill with any symptoms. Is hep b similar to hep c, where one could be chronically infected without knowing it?My gut feeling tells me, I should get them tested, but my GP (very good, kind and helpful) says it is not necessary, as if they had chronic hep b, they would be quite ill.Just FYI,    all the other kids tested hep c negative.Thank you before hand for any info on this.Marcia

Similar to a space ship, the SeaOrbiter is planned to allow scientists and others a residential yet mobile research station positioned under the oceans' surface. The station will have laboratories, workshops, living quarters and a pressurized deck to support divers and submarines.[1][2][3]SeaOrbiter is a project of the ""Floating oceanographic laboratory"" organisation. It is headed by French architect Jacques Rougerie, oceanographer Jacques Piccard and astronaut Jean-Loup Chretien. The construction of the Oceanographic Laboratory started in 2011. The cost is expected to be around $52.7 millionThe laboratory is semi-submersible ocean going craft and weighs 1000 tons. It has a total height of 51 meters with 31 meters below sea level.It is designed to float vertically and drift with the ocean currents but has two small propellers allowing it to modify its trajectory and maneuver in confined waters. Underwater robots can be sent from the laboratory to explore the seabed. The hull is made Ã¢ € ‹Ã¢ € ‹of an alloy comprising aluminum and magnesium is five times thicker than that of a conventional vessel.Its vertical alignment in the sea will leave a small part visible above the surface with much larger accommodation and laboratories below the sea's surface.

DEMO	Tiny Bumps on Labia	I recently noticed small bumps on my labia minora.    They're very tiny, and there's a larger area of them on the right side than the left.

TRMT	43 yr old sudden immune problems	"Hi,I am 43 years old and about ten years ago started breaking out and gradually became allergic to certain foods and ALL alcohol. The last three years I have been on low dose accutane, although my derm wanted me to do a much higher dose, my body just couldn't take it so I do my own dosage of 20 mgs per week. I try to prolong it as long as I can. Now, on top of this I also take antihistamines for my allergies. I am basically dried up. My skin, which was once VERY soft and pretty is now tight and itchy, obviously from all of the dehydrating drugs. I have a great relationship with clean food and only imbibe on the weekends, though nothing crazy (i.e fast food). I don't drink flavoured sodas, eat junk or over drink (yes, I still drink). I am currently taking liquid vitamin D3. About 5000 IUs a day hoping that maybe this is the reason for all the ""body wars"" inside. I was tested and had a low, but not detrimental, number count on my vitamin D score. Is there a supplement I can take that will help with all this dryness? I can't bathe in creams any longer. They don't work, most stink and I wanna to work from the inside. Any suggestions?"

I'm not sure if this is all related, but for the past 2 months, approximately the same time that he received the flumist vaccine, he has had random fevers.    He will feel    fine all day and out of the blue will feel warm, usually with a fever around 101, this is accompanied by body aches, headache (sinus pain/pressure). Usually the fever is brought down by motrin and he sleeps off the pain. He wakes up    feeling fine after a nap.His PCM is saying this is all allergies and sent him for a TB test (negative), CT scan and has run a bunch of blood work (waiting for results on the blood work). He is currently on Amoxicillin (day 5 of 7). After another fever last night the Dr on    call, sent us to the ER. Of course by the time we were seen the fever was gone and after    looking at his CT scan and seeing it was clear, the ER Dr said that it was no way sinus' or allergies, and suggested seeing an infectious disease expert.Is the PCM n the right track, or the ER Dr? Trying to figure out where to direct my husband so that when he    goes into the military clinic tomorrow and they are trying to get rid of him, he    knows what he needs to get the correct care and not the run around.

DISE	Klonopin Withdrawal Question	Hi.    This is the third time in the past year that I have gone cold turkey off of Klonopin.    Each time the dose that I withdrew from has been less....First time, 3 mg, second time, 2 mg, this time, 1 mg    Each time the first several weeks are agonizing, but the end result lasts for many months at a time.    The only reason I went back on Klonopin at a lower dose, with a doctor, has been major external stressors, post traumatic stress disorder to be exact due to an abusive relationship.    Now, the withdrawal symptoms are much easier to handle than the first few times, but still difficult to get through.    Do you have any suggestions for staying off of Klonopin for good without going back to my prescribed dose first?

SOCL	Part-Timers Losing Health Insurance May Want To Thank Their Companies	"http://finance.yahoo.com/blogs/the-exchange/part-timers-losing-healthcare-insurance-may-want-thank-210354500.htmlHow terrible. Home Depot (HD) and Trader JoeÃ¢ € ™s have decided to stop offering health insurance for part-time employees, moving them over to Obamacare instead. More companies seem sure to follow. And more wailing about greedy, heartless corporations is sure to follow that. Some workers may start to drop dead from sheer anxiety before Obamacare even goes into effect on January 1.Once the new health law has been in place for a few months, however, Part-Time America may issue a collective sigh of relief. Nobody ever held up todayÃ¢ € ™s part-time ""mini-med"" plans as model coverage. The majority of part-time workers donÃ¢ € ™t even get health insurance, and those who do typically get diluted plans with limited benefits they still have to pay something for. Ã¢ € œYou have to question whether thatÃ¢ € ™s really insurance,Ã¢ €  says Paul Fronstin, director of the health research program at the Employee Benefits Research institute. Ã¢ € œThey may not cover prescription drugs, and if you get cancer or end up in the hospital, they probably wonÃ¢ € ™t help you a whole lot.Ã¢ € Insurance offered under the Affordable Care Act, by contrast, could end up being a much better deal. Obamacare is complicated, and it will require many people to do detailed research on their insurance options instead of having an employer do it for them. There have also been elaborate efforts by foes of the program to depict it as The Ruination of Everything. So itÃ¢ € ™s not surprising that part-timers being told their employer is cutting them loose and sending them over to Obamacare are a little jumpy.Actually enrolling could calm them down, however. Obamacare was designed to make decent health insurance affordable for people who otherwise canÃ¢ € ™t afford it, and whether you love or hate the program, it seems likely to succeed at that basic mission. ThatÃ¢ € ™s because the program subsidizes the cost of insurance based on your income, with the largest subsidies going to those with the lowest incomes.Lots of confusionThere are many insurance choices under Obamacare that vary by state and apply to different income levels, which adds to the confusion. But the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation has built a helpful calculator that lets you enter your income and a few other basic details to get an idea of how much insurance would cost you under the program.A single parent with three kids and an annual income of $25,000, for instance, could get an $8,800 insurance plan for a total out-of-pocket cost of $500 per year. Subsidies, in other words, cover 94% of the cost. Try to beat that on part-time pay.A two-parent family with two kids and a $50,000 income could get a $10,000 plan for $3,365, with subsidies covering 66% of the cost. ThereÃ¢ € ™s one catch: You only qualify for such deals if youÃ¢ € ™re not able to get coverage through your employer. So if youÃ¢ € ™re a part-timer whose company canceled your watered-down insurance coverage, it may have actually done you a favor.Trader JoeÃ¢ € ™s is one employer known for offering generous health care benefits, even for part-timers (until now). But even those workers could end up better off under Obamacare. In an internal email published by the Washington Post, a Trader JoeÃ¢ € ™s exec provided some calculations for a part-time employee who earns about $24,000 per year and has been paying about $167 per month as her share of a Trader JoeÃ¢ € ™s policy similar to a Ã¢ € œsilverÃ¢ €  plan under the ACA. If she enrolls in Obamacare, the subsidized cost would fall to about $70 per month for nearly identical coverage. And thatÃ¢ € ™s before a $500 annual stipend Trader JoeÃ¢ € ™s plan to offer part-timers to help them pay for insurance.Some will pay moreWithout a doubt, there will be some people who end up paying more for insurance as their employers offer less. Mostly, they will be higher-income workers who lose employer-provided coverage and have to buy it through Obamacare. Subsidies are phased out at 400% of the poverty line, which this year is $45,960 for an individual and $94,200 for a family of 4. Above that, people have to pay the full cost of coverage.Other companies have been changing their health care coverage in ways that sound like theyÃ¢ € ™re related to Obamacare but arenÃ¢ € ™t. Walgreens (WAG), for instance, will begin requiring employees to choose an insurance plan from a private Ã¢ € œexchangeÃ¢ €  that offers at least 25 choices, instead of the three or four WalgreenÃ¢ € ™s has been offering. The concept is similar to the public exchanges that will be up and running under Obamacare, beginning October 1, with coverage beginning January 1. But the government plays no role and offers no subsidies in the exchange WalgreenÃ¢ € ™s is joining.WalgreenÃ¢ € ™s will still bear much of the cost of its employeesÃ¢ € ™ coverage, through fixed stipends it grants employees to help pay for care. But workers will now have to educate themselves more, choose coverage from a wide range of options, and pay the difference if they choose Cadillac coverage that costs more than the subsidy covers. The idea is to give employees a stronger incentive to control health care spending, by requiring them to pay more of their own money as costs rise.IBM (IBM), Time-Warner (TWX) and General Electric (GE) have enacted similar plans for retirees, and companies in general are getting more aggressive about finding new ways to control health care spending as it become more and more of a burden. Obamacare may be part of the solution, but many companies would be doing this even without the health reform law. If the scaremongering over Obamacare ever stops, weathering changes in health care benefits may no longer require hypertension medication."
FAML	2 year old constantly hungry and won't sleep	I have a two year old who use to be a picky eater.    Over the last few weeks he's constantly eating and is never tired.    I know in a growth spurt they eat a lot but I thought they were also suppose to sleep a lot!    I'm just wondering if there's something seriously wrong because he keeps coming out of his room at all hours of the night to say he's hungry.    Am I just worrying too much or is there a hidden problem here?    If anyone can help me please do!
SOCL	getting blamed	"I'm 14 years old and my sister is 10 years old. We argue a lot but it seems like most of the time its always started by her. I do admit that I may start some but most of the time their caused by her. She talks to me like I'm stupid and thick, never says please and thank you to me when she wants something doing for herself. When I do tell her to say please to me, she answers me like this, ""why should I?"" My parents are absolutley sick of us arguing but I just feel like we both get told off but its always her fault and not my'n. Because there are consequences for me when ""we"" argue, but she always manages to get what she wants by the end. I'm not sure what I should say to my parents about this because I want this blaming to stop and for them to realise what happens, because everytime I try and explain what happened during the arguement, they don't want to listen. Any suggestions about how I should go about saying something? And why they don't see that its not me but her?Thanks for any answers"

DISE	Herpes scare	Hi,12 days ago, I had unprotected sex with an 18 year old girl. I have a history of hypochondria, and so began checking myself obsessively for a few days after.    Four days after the encounter I noticed a slight painless redness on the glans(glands)of my penis.    Over the past week or so it has seemed to get better and then worse (possibly because I have been checking it so often.    There are no blisters/vesicles, and it is completely painless, but noticeable in good lighting.    I have done a lot of research, and have seen doctor HHH write many times that herpes ALWAYS starts a rash with vesicles which then burst and crust over.    Also it seems that primary infections are accompanied by fever/swollen lymph nodes, neither of which are present.    Does this seem like a possible case of herpes? or just irritation from over-checking/obsessing?    Also, the girl has told me that she has only had 2 sexual partners before me.Thanks for any help

TRMT	My mother is eating herself to death	My mother is 62 years old and obese.    She was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few years ago and is now admitted to a local hospital with an inflamed gall bladder.    She is to receive IV antibiotics until surgery can be performed.    I do not believe that her physician is being frank with her regarding her eating habits and how it is affecting her health.    Is there someone in the hospital that can talk to her and make her understand that she is killing herself with food?
DEMO	transvaginal US for polyp?	hi- i have a couple of questions so i think i'll post 2 messages. am very worried. on last sonogram, there is a small nodule of about 1 centimeter. the said they can't tell if its a polyp or a fibroid. it's location is in the canal which i think is close to the cervix (this is in addition to 4 fibroids that were found; 1 year go, there were 2 fibroids, and 2 years ago, there was 1. The largest one is 3cm up from 2.5 last year. there's a combination of subserserosal and submucosal.)Although for    most people, the gyn would recommend an endometrial biopsy, she is trying to spare me and get more info first. she says iget too much pain with just the speculum and she does not think i would be able to tolerate it. i think she just doesnt want a rough day -she'd prefer i'd have a d&c under general, but i do not want this.anyway, she says maybe a transvaginal sonogram would be able to tell whether the nodule was a polyp or fibroid. i only had the regular pelvic transabdominal one so far. but is this really true? i thought it is very hard to tell the differece between polyp and fibroidif you have    a small one which is submucosal, even on transvaginal exam. another words, i don't know ifit would help at all. I would rather not waste time, energy,, and discomfort (and cleanliness issues) if its useless. I am not sexually active right now and think it would be painful and difficult (I did one years ago and HATED it. the report did notinclude the thickness of the endometrial liining, though did say the rest of the endometrium looked normal.i have plenty of symptoms; periods are very heavy, am anemic, they last at least7 days and are coming every 24 days. I am 50 years old, so likely just another 2 years of this... but besides the nodule, these are also symptoms of endometrial canncer, if one were being careful, they would do more invasive tests. but again, biopsies and threading things thru catheter thru my cervix i am tryingto avoid because of general health issue; eventually i may not be able to avoid it.back to question - does anyone know if transvaginal US really might be able to tell the difference given how hard they are to disinguish- or am i just wasting precious energy/time?thanks
PREG	Could the Pill affect estrogen?	I have been on the pill for 8 years. I was told recently that I may have an estrogen deficiency. Could BC cause this? I have went off the pill. I took my last pill Saturday. I wanna do a trial run and see if I notice a change in my body. Could BC cause an estrogen deficiency? I am on Yasmin....but have not been on this one for 8 years. I was on Alesse for a few years then they changed it and put me on Lo-ovral...and now Im on Yasmin.
SOCL	Pre Grief	I apologize if I should not be asking this question on this forum.My mother has advanced ovarian cancer (wow I just typed that).    We have been battling for about a year and a half.    I cry and I feel like I am already grieving the loss.I also feel bad because I pray for a change in the situation, but I still have this pre-grief thing going on.    Is this normal?    I am an only child so for me this is my worst fear because I feel like my life will cease as I know it without my mom.    We are so close that these words do not do our relationship justice.I need some advice help.
PREG	Just fed up... rant not a question really :o(	Hey,I have been reading and some posting since I had my EP on the 3rd of Sept. I was 8 weeks gone. I had to have my right tube removed along with the pregnancy. Recovery has been kind in that my stitches have healed well, no major pains other than ovulation-type pains on both sides which I can control with painkillers. Slowly I have gained my energy back and ready to go back to work on Monday. I dont feel any particular emotional loss to the EP, other than saddened it had to happen. I am keep to start trying again and as such have become 'addicted' to sites such as this with uplifting success storied from other ladies. I have not bleed other than two days of very light spotting post surgery so am waiting for AF to arrive.The thing is I am just fed up! :twisted: :twisted: :twisted: Does anyone else feel this way? I have spent the past three weeks trying to figure out what could have caused the EP. I have had a chlamydia test done and am awaiting results. I have thought back to the past year to locate any pelvic discomfort or pain as a reason. I guess I am trying to figure out not only what caused it but how I can prevent it. Patience is not something I have much of so waiting 3 months is driving me insane. I am hoping work will help distract my counting the days :)the things is- I feel as if I am so alone (though I am not alone at all). As if there is no-one who really understands or cares enough to ask. My husband seems to be carrying on as normal.I have read many womens partners and husbands have done the same- that it is their way of coping.I feel as if he is being rather inconsiderate of what I have gone through- his lack of knowledge/ignorance of the procedure or my recovery-his ability to think I can be ok-to think his about his work as so important. He has even gone so far as to make comments about my recovery as if I am faking or exaggerating it. He made out his comment was a joke -am I being too sensitive? He made some statement the other night how his work is going to be stressful and be the death of him and I needed to be considerate and give him the time he needs. I feel that is all I have given him with our whole marriage. to cut that story short- I have been the one that has got the ball rolling on the engagement and wedding (17/4/9) of which I am still waiting on the honeymoon. We had planned to start TTC after our honeymoon but it [honeymoon] never happened because of his work or something. Then we fell pregnant and then the EP. So now I asked him to get the honeymoon sorted as it would be a nice break for us and he has done nothing. To boot he has now told me he has alot of stress' at work. Am I being rather insensitive about his stress at work? with all the engagement/wedding/honeymoon saga over the past year I have asked myself if he is right for me and now this EP is making me ask it again. I know you guys can not answer for me but I wonder if anyone else had these thoughts. I feel as if I had to go through and do it all and he gets away with nothing- carrying on with life as if nothing has happened. It's not as if these thoughts have come later on either. i started feeling them soon after my EP was removed.It is all so confusing as I am aware I could be focusing all my EP emotions onto him and taking it out on him. Does it sound like I am doing that?I am hoping sitting at home has exacerbated all my thoughts and going back to work will do me the world of good. The one thing we are both agreeing on is TTC as soon as we can. I have had conflicting advice on whent o start but am waiting to see how AF is when she arrives. I have not had a bad recovery post op so I hope she will be kind this time...Thanks for thaking the time to read.. I know it is a bit self pitiful but I have been brewing about it for almost three weeks :?Minimin
FAML	Caught my 6yrs old son being abuse by 8 yrs old boy	"Just a week before schoold ended for the summer, i cought my 6 yrs old son performing some sex act with a 8 yrs. it happen in my back yard.    On dat day someting told me to look on what they were doing, i was so shock when i saw my son on his knee with pants down and the other boy standing in front my son face with pants down.    I've done what was suppose to be done, call local police, talk to the parents.    But i believe there is more in this story.    Police as close the case cause of the boy's being in close age but it involves more then 5 boy's, but yet since then that 8 yrs old now 9 is bullying my son all the time. he calls him the ""Gaylord"" and so on.    He's always hitting my son. we have told his parent's but nothing has been done.    Now that the new schoold year as start my sons has open up to his teacher.    what i saw on that day actually happen more then once, even happen in my house.    i'm mix up dont know what to do but i believe one of those boys is being abuse badly, and the law is not looking into it.    my feeling is very strong there is another boy in trouble if they dont provide proper conselling for those kids they might do it to someone way younger. so what should i do?"

DEMO	Am I really this time?? Late and pos	Well for those who dont know my story, in short I had a faint pos in march followed by bleeding drs telling me Im not preg, say gyny said all is fine but didnt have full notes and no scan pics but made app for 6months or I could go bk if I felt I need to.Do basically my periods have been late each month I think max was about 3 4 days, but always neg tests (Think eyes were playing tricks thinking it could be pos). So this time I was due sept 26th making me 9 days late, and no signs of turning up. I done a test yesterday and it kinda looked v faint pos, so I thought here we go again, and waited til today. This one seems darker but still faint. I had a bleed on 14th thru til about 17th none 16th. I have had bleeding when I was preg before but that was when I knew I was, but what Im a little confused on is, could the 14th of been a weird period and I got preg after that and thats why its faint (test says reads 25 muI 10 days after concep) or was that just an inbetween bleed and maybe this isnt a good pregnancy or something. I thought I was getting energy again, but now I get tired all of a sudden and need to sleep whereas before was just constant low energy. I know I should go GP but I went so much before I want to be sure this time I guess. Can a digi test that says preg/not detect at 25 muI? The only reason why Im thinking it could be pos this time is cos still no AF.What should I do? Any opinions or this happened to them? Thanks again u guys :-)
DISE	Intenstinal metaplasia and chronic gastritis	I have had 2 upper endoscopys and the first showed stomach ulcers and chronic gastritis with intestinal metaplasia.    The second showed chronic gastritis.    I am having stomach pains, gnawing, in my upper abdomen that wake me up at night.

GOAL	Painful white bumps on tongue	I got a very painful sore on my inner lower lip and the doctor said it was probably a cankor sore. Within 4 days I got these painful white bumps on my tongue that are almost pus filled. They are all over my upper front tongue and are multiplying. It hurts to have anything cold or hot. I think they are contagious. The sore on inner lip is almost healed but the more that heals the more the bumps/spots on my tongue multiply. I've also been dealing with these sores I get on my body that also have a white root-like core to them and take months to heal. I was told years ago that I have autoimmunity disease and wonder if this is a specific one. I had CBC done and my white blood cell count is high. I've been on multiple antibiotics over the last 3 months but none have helped. I also had a bad staph infection and am concerned the antibiotics did not cure that and it is in my bloodstream but I don't know if that would show up in the mouth like that. I have been very very clean, brushing, rinsing, antibacterial soaps, etc. Please help!

GOAL	Trying to decide toric or not	"I am 54 years old. I have cataracts in both eyes. I am schedule for surgery in two weeks. I have astigmatism in both eyes. The doctor is recommending toric lenses so I will have optimal distance and crispness but will have to wear reading glasses. The cost for the torics is $1100 each (on top) and no insurance coverage - a real reach for me financially.    I use a computer all day and a cash register weekends. Wearing my contacts (gas perms) today I have to wear reading glasses and while in the car I have to use them to see the dash, car clock, etc. I can't see my cell phone without them or even put on make up (oh no!!) . No contacts, I wear glasses and just look under or over or remove when I need to read or see up close.Because my of my up close vision requirements I wonder if I should go with the Toric. If I go with the ""standard"" lens can I still wear gas perm contacts? I am afraid to make the wrong decision.So bottome line:Toric or standard ... inquiring minds want to know.Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!"

I really want to be fit and trim by the time I go and have started to attend a great clinic here in Asheville for weight loss.    They give me the b12 plus lipotropic shots, supplements and already I have lost 4 lbs since I started one week ago.

FAML	No longer sleeping	My son has been a fabulous sleeper since he was about a year.    He's now almost 3, and he's a twin, so he shares a room with his brother.    He is now suddenly waking 5 to 8 times a night, fully awake when he does.    He wants us to cover him, kiss him, whatever.    We are not great with letting him cry it out.    In fact, we can't.    He's waking up the whole household over and over, and we're exhausted.    I'm just not sure what to do with him--he has a nightlight, a very regimented bed time routine that we've done for 3 years (bath, books, warm milk, bed), he has music that plays the same song over and over each night.    Please help!
PREG	Can she be pregnant after fingering?	"Me and my girl decided to 'play' around last night, the 23rd of January. So we were kissing, then feeling and a couple hours later we were having sex, with a condom of course. well we were actually having sex for maybe 10 minutes and she says ""oh wait, I don't want a urinary tract infection, let me go pee"" and she left the room for maybe 2 minutes max. Well I didn't think about it then but I know if you lose the 'boner' in a condom somehow the condom can become ineffective. I couldn't get it hard enough to stay in her because she was real tight and along with the peeing incident, my cat jumped on the bed and someone called both our phones. so we decided to just end it and i took the condom off. we made out and she gave me a ********. then I fingered her. now I'm wondering if it is realistically possible that I got enough pre-*** on my fingers while taking the condom off (I didn't ejaculate in it) to get her pregnant while fingering her? Her period ended 3 or 4 days before we had sex, I know for a fact the condom didn't break, she is going to take Plan B Tomorrow, less than 48 hours after the incident, and again there was just pre-*** in the condom. should we be in the clear? This is gonna be a long three weeks... Help!?!?!?"

FAML	Help me! What is wrong with my 3 year old	I have a 5 year old with severe autism, he was diagnosed 2 and a half years ago.For the past year and a half I have noticed my other son who is 3, turning 4 in a couple of months is not developing as expected.Everytime I give him food to eat he will throw it or smear it into the floors and walls, each time he does this i remove the food from him and give him 3 minutes time out, I have been doing this for 12 months with no result, he is also very agressive, he constantly hits and bite me or throws things at me, again he gets 3 minutes time out each time but it doesnt make a difference. He attacks his teachers at school, he is not interested at all in being potty trained, he smears his stools from his underpants all over my walls and floors.He is constantly on the go from 4am until 8pm, he doesn't sit down for a second, and if he does he has to mess with something or someone.Even if i take him out for a treat he will climb all over the place. He also seems to have no sense of danger even after hurting himself numerous time doing the same things. He also doesn't take any instruction from anyone, at school or from me. When you talk to him it just goes right through him, he hs had hearing and sight checked and they are fine.The health visitor has referred his to a child development centre after seeing his behaviour at the 3 year check up, she told me I am doing everything right with him, like praising every little good thing he does, ignoring some behaviours and using the time out disipline.I am at a dead end, I am so physically tired and mentally drained with trying He isn't interested in any toys either, he only ever wants to play with toilet rolls.My house is a mess as every day he breaks something, he has just pushed my brand new tv off the table today, smashed 6 eggs on the floor earlier on. It is like this everyday. What could possibly be wrong with him? Any ideas? His speech is fine and so is his eye contact.

I have just recently met this guy and we are becoming friends and all that and i want to tell him i have bipolar but    i don't know how he will react. but if i don't tell him its like I'm keeping secrets from him and i don't like doing that. What if he doesn't like me after i tell him or he treats me different? i don't have much time with him on my own and my other mates already know and were telling me they were goner tell him because they think it would make him laugh, i know that sounds terrible ( they think that my behaviors are weird sometimes and i think they think bipolar is a joke) :(. My other friends only know because my mum told them and i got so mad at her for that. i want this friend to know because he is going through some stuff of his own and i want him to know that I will listen and not judge him if he is brave enough to talk to me. Do i just blurt it out in front of him and explain later? or not tell him?How do you tell your friends about your bipolar? do they normally react OK?Cheers
FAML	14 year old son ADHD	MY son was diag with ADHD when he was in 3rd grade. When then put him on medication and that went well he did good in school grades came up but then he had ugly mood swings when he would not take it and he did not each much and he did not like how it made him feel. He then decided he was did not want to take it anymore so in 6th grade we stop the medication. It has been a struggle to get him through Middle school. He starts High school this year and I am so looking for maybe a more natural way to help him with his ADHD, His main problem is organization and attention span, sometimes he gives me the attitude but thatÃ¢ € ™s not as bad as it was before.. I guess I am just wondering if anyone out there feels like me that medication is not the only answer for ADHD? Any sugg? Ideas would be greatly appreciated ;)

DEMO	CHEEK INFLAMMATION	So i had my wisdom teeth pulled out on Dec.30th 2010 and on the 21st of January 2011 my cheek started to be inflamed. I went to the oral surgeon and he said that it was an infection, so he cut me up to let fluid drain he said. It took a week to heal, and i was fine for 2 days, then    it got inflamed once again. So i went back to the oral surgeon again and the second time he cut me up almost all the way past my molar and deep enough that the bone was showing. I got stitches and i was sent home once again to heal for another week. Both times he has put me on 15 Amoxicillin pills and 150 mg of Clindamycin. Second time he gave me an iv, to put in sodium chloride, and i was not given any amoxicillin but kept on the clyndamycin. My cheek has been going down but i was unable to open my mouth still due to pressure and irritation way in the back of my mouth. I can hardly open my mouth now and my cheek looked fine as of 5 hours ago. Currently it is making its way back to being inflamed swollen. I took my last clyndamycin pill today at 9:00pm. I am very frustrated at this point due to the lack of nutrition i have had to deal with for two weeks and i would like to know whether i should just go to the hospital or go back to this oral surgeon and complain about my cheek again? is it even worth it?
DEMO	Cycle Confusion??	HI!I am new here, but have a question. I have been trying to conceive for the past 4 months, unsuccessfully! This month, I did the home ovulation tests. I was ovulating on the 12th or 13th. So of course, we tried our hardest! Then, on the 20th I started having a pinkish/browinsh discharge. That lasted two days. I am not due to start my period until the 28th. I took a pregnancy test on Sunday, the 22nd, but it was negative. Could I still be pregnant? Or is it probably just related to my upcoming period? Thanks!
FAML	Selecting a therapist	"My son has some behavioral issues and we are seeking help through a psychologist.    We recently met with a doctor.    He told us that he would like to have permission to keep our son's ""secrets"" from us, even though by law we are entitled to know everything our son tells him.    We have never had any counseling experience, so I wanted to know if this is a normal request.    I am not comfortable with this.    I do not think it is prudent to give permission to another adult to keep secrets from a parent, nor do I want to set the precedent with my son to do this.Thank you."

TRMT	Night Time Incontinence	I have had my pouch over 16 years.    Since then I have become hypothyroid, have developed fibromyalgia and am being treated for developing Lupus.    I am on Lyrica to help with the fibromyalgia.    In the last month I have started having night time incontinence once or twice a week.    It is not watery but normal stool.    I asked my doctor to treat me for pouchitis in case that is the cause and am on Cipro and Flagyl right now.    I am noticing that my muscles in my anus don't seem as tight as they were and don't know if that is due to my long term pouch or if maybe my Lyrica is relaxing things?    Does anyone have experience with this?
FAML	7 yr Old Daughter is wetting her pants	"My 7 year old daughter has consistently been wetting her pants for the past 5 months.    We have had an extremely difficult time potty training her.     My husand and I work splite shifts, our potty training techniques were different.    She had no consistency.    She went to all day Kindergarten, had some accidents, hit and miss.    But we never TOTALLY got rid of them.    She doesn't want to stop what it is she is doing to go to the bathroom.    This school year - 1st grade - has been exceptionally worse.    The first few months were not steady.    Now the days that are dry are easy to count, because there are so few of them.    She is mostly dry during the day but in the evenings, when I am home she 99% of time will wet her pants.    We have tried everything.    Stickers each dry day, that didn't work.    Her teacher was even nice enough to offer her a prize when we said she had a successful goal period.    She was allowed to do that once.    We then moved on to her giving us a favorite toy of hers to keep when she has an accident.    That didn't work well. I will admit that my anger over this issue is getting bad.    Now her dad - who is the most patient person I know - is even getting frustrated.    She is not wetting the bed.    The only thing that has changed since January is that we got a new puppy.    She loves the puppy!!    Oh and she turned 7 in March.    She cannot stand her birthday, she tells me that she doesn't want to acknowledge her birthday, she doesn't want to get older.    She has told me also, when we are playing and I say ""Wait, I have to go to that bathroom"".    She will say ""Oh mommy just ignore it and it will go away"".She will never tell us or her teacher when she has wet herself.    NEVER.Is this just our child or are we doin something wrong."

DISE	Sister in Law is a terrible addict..	Hey everyone, My sister in law has been a user of percs and pretty much any other pain killer for the past 4 years. When i first met her she didn't do any drugs. She was a wonderful person who cared and love for her family and kids. five years ago she was admitted to the hospital for serve cramps in her stomach and was given percs and from that moment till now she has been taking them everyday. I have lost ever ounce of respect I have ever had for her. She has stolen thousands of dollars from her family and friends.    If something comes up missing she blames her 4 year old little boy. It's the most sadest thing I have ever seen. My husband has cut off all communication with her. She has done so many bad things to him he can't find it in his heart to ever forgive her. She has had numerous boyfriends in the passing years and remember one time picking up our niece for the weekend and her telling us how her house is like a revolving door for men. I was completely crushed to think that she had to see all this crap. She treats her daughter more as a friend than her parent. She talks to her dealers in front of them, puts her family down in front of them and talking very very bad in front of the kids. She doesn't cook for them and vary rarely cleans the house. She stays in her room and watches tv or lay in bed reading a book. she has totally shut down from life, her kids and friends. Now it has come to the point of no return our niece has started trying alcohol, going to parties. talking to adults like sh*t and has the worse attitude. Plus the amount of boys she has dated as she said is sick considering her age.I honestly don't know what to do anymore. She is such a strong manipulator that she makes people feel sorry for her which makes it easier for the people to enable her to continue use. Her parents pay for everything for her and the kids. They don't fully understand what they are doing because they justify it by thinking it's helping the kids. My husband and i try and open his mothers eyes to the fact she isn't helping her she is helping KILL her. She just doesn't get it. We try to tell her that our niece her granddaughter is following the same path as her mother and it's not healthy. That's when the grandmother gets defensive shuts down and gets so angry about my husband speaking the truth. He is the type of person to tell you how it is. I really admire that about him. How do we get his parents to see how bad his sister addiction really is and how much it's destroying their family. Thank you so much for reading this story.
DEMO	Small lump on vaginal lip?	When I was shaving last night, I noticed a lump on one side of my vagina, close to the lip. It's a little smaller than a pea and it's kinda hard, but not very (I mean, it doesn't feel like a rock, but it isn't squishy either. It's right in between the two.), and it only hurts just enough for me to notice when pressure is applied. I'm not sexually active and am still a virgin, so I seriously doubt it's an STD. Has anyone ever had something like this? Any ideas on what it could be and if I can treat it without a doctor visit, at least for a while?

Mother to two small children.About two months ago I started having pain in my left calf. It continued to get worse with no explanation for the pain. I had an ultra sound done to make sure it was not a blood clot. The ultra sound did not show any abnormalities.Since then I have been experiencing left leg weakness and strange feelings making me want to move my leg. I also just noticed last week that my calf muscle is starting to become deformed. It does look like it has a deep indentation in it.I also have been having twitching all over my body. The twitches    are really fast little twitches that move around my arms legs and even my    fingers and toes. The other morning I had a very irregular heart beat that lasted about 15 minutes. Also, my jaw gets really sore when I chew gum or something hard like a granola bar.I have been to my doctor and just had blood work done today. I am having an x-ray of my leg tomorrow.I have a PPo so I can self refer should I just go to a Neurologist instead of my regular Doctor?Thank you for your time.

DISE	4mm tumor in cauda equina	Hi, I've recently had more intense lower spine issues which resulted initially in my being admitted to my local hospital ER for cauda equina syndrome checks as I'm also suffering with constipation.    I spent 24 hours in the hospital to be told I wasn't constipated despite having only passed an amount a rabbit would have been ashamed of once a week for a period of twelve weeks.    I was told I'd receive an appointment for an MRI and was sent on my way.    I went for the first MRI which was an Lumbar spine series and was called back 3 days later for further scans and with contrast (gadolinium).    Following these I've had the results back and have an L5-S1 herniation, as well as a 4mm cauda equina tumor, presumed to be a neuroma.I've been trying to google and find out what 4mm actually relates to within the cauda equina to no avail.    I've been referred to a neurosurgeon, and am curious to know what if any treatment would be invoved with this neuroma if anyone at all knows.    I should add the neuroma is at the L4 region.Thanks in advance

TRMT	low white count after immunization	I'm entering nursing school, and before starting my clinicals, I had to get MMR, Pertussis, and Tetanus vaccines. Ten days after vaccination, I had bloodwork done. My white count was low (2.8), as were my neutrophils (1.5) and the monocytes were high (15). Also, I woke up one morning, about a week after the immunizations, with hands and feet that had swollen, painful joints. I rarely get sick, in fact, I haven't had as much as a sniffle for over 3 years. Can the low counts be from the immunizations? I'm not at risk for HIV.

So far I can see all three distances--close, medium, and far--with my right eye, but with my left eye I can see clearly only when reading. Medium and far distances are blurred. Is this normal?
TRMT	Adrenal Insufficiency	How can I treat my partial adrenal insufficiency without taking prednisone. I'm taking 10mg and want to discontinue it do to side effects. I've been on it for years. I'm also on hypothyroid med. I know that dosage needs to be reduced slowly but withdrawals are hard to handle. Can I start with ginseng, licorice root or bupleurum root?
GOAL	eye trauma,  6 months point	I am looking for help with terminology as well as any comments about my condition.    I am a late 40's male that has always had glasses: astigmatism + myopia. Three years ago I was treated for a conjuctival lymphoma with biopsy and radiation.    Then, six months ago I was struck by a softball in the other eye, causing orbital fracture, among others (nose, zygo, maxillary).    Traumatic mydriasis. Diplopia since the accident.    Disconjugate gaze. One reconstruction placed titanium plates for fractures, and titanium mesh for sinus cavity and for floor of orbit.    The inferior rectus muscle formed scar tissue (hematoma) and anchored into the mesh, and the orbital implant had slipped.    A revision surgery and forced duction test one month later restored 80% of motility by replacing the orbit floor mesh with MedPor, but upgaze is affected because the muscle cannot relax enough. The orbital globe is maybe 2mm+ lower than before accident. There was not much left of the orbit floor to support the implant.Now I am still seeing three doctors: cornea/disease, ped ophthalmologist and ophthalmic plastic surgeon.     Recently tried    prism lenses with 14 degrees of correction (split 7 degrees up/down for each eye) and really had trouble reading with the 1.5 x bifocal.    I became nauseous from walking with them.    The damaged eye has a shadow (mydriasis +astigmatism?).    Besides the general 20/40 corrected vision in the damaged eye (still taking pred forte and combigan) because of perhaps a cataract and remaining iritis,    I cannot seem to fuse the two images easily.    Every time I blink things go back to double for a second or two.    When I move my head to look at something, I have to re-focus and get the images to fuse again.     Things are fine if I am sitting and watching TV but I really don't do that much since my team exited the NCAA tourney.My strabismus doctor says that surgery cannot fix the problems and delay in fusing images. He said that 14 degrees correction is treatable with corrective lenses, but if it were say 3x that much he would recommend surgery.Is there any experience in this area, will this problem in fusing images get better?    I cannot imagine trying to drive like that, seeing two roads for a time. Not to mention photophobia from the mydriasis.     Is there a term for this delay in fusing two images?Is the vertigo/nausea/general problems using the prism lenses something that can be gotten used to, or perhaps there is really something wrong with the lenses -- I admit it must be hard to fill this Rx with all the things going on.grasping for info, or even looking for what questions to ask my doctor at the next visits, in 2 months.Should I just keep wearing the eye patch and call it -- good as it gets?    of course a doctor doesn't want to discourage a patient, and every case is different.     Surely someone has had a similar injury.thanks for any help or comments.George
PREG	full of excitment	Hello ladies, It has been a while since I last came to this site, about 11wks now.Since the last 3rd miscarriage we've decided to take a break of ttc. Taking a break and relaxing has truly been the right decision we had made.My AF was suppossed to come visit on the 8/10. Still NO AF, took several of EPT's all came back negative, for some strange reason I'm not sweating the negative results, my doctor scheduled me for a blood test on tuesday, I'm pretty sure it will come back positive. But if not I'm alright with that also.But have anyone take an HPT and it came up negative but still was pregnant?I will post the results when I come back from the doctors, wish me luck, and good luck to everyone who is ttc.

SOCL	N. Korea Severs Ties With South As Crisis Deepens	"May 25, 2010Relations between North and South Korea deteriorated to their worst condition in years as Pyongyang announced it would cut all ties with Seoul and expel some South Koreans working at a joint industrial park in the border city of Kaesong.Heard On 'Morning Edition':The reaction came amid rising tensions after an investigative report concluded that North Korea was to blame for sinking a South Korean naval vessel in March, killing 46 sailors.South Korea on Tuesday resumed propaganda broadcasts across the North-South border. The North has threatened to fire artillery shells at South Korean loudspeakers used in the broadcasts. Pyongyang also said it will resume its own broadcasts.Reports also said the North had ordered its military on high alert and that South Korean ships and aircraft would be prohibited from passing through its territory.Restrictions On Trade, TravelIn addition to taking its complaint against North Korea to the U.N. Security Council, South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said Monday that his country would cut off much of its trade with the North.Lee also said North Korean merchant vessels will no longer be allowed to use a shortcut through South Korean waters, a move that would force the North Korean ships to expend more time and fuel.But analysts say the measures won't be enough to change the North's behavior.An international investigation found that the explosion of the South Korean warship Cheonan on March 26 was caused by a torpedo launched from a North Korean submarine.North Korea has denied any involvement in the sinking and said it would treat the South's retaliatory measures as an act of war.U.S. Backs South, Looks To U.N. ActionThe United States has fully backed its ally South Korea. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was in Beijing Tuesday seeking support from China on U.N. Security Council action against North Korea. She was headed later Tuesday for meetings Wednesday in Seoul.The United States maintains a deterrent force of about 28,500 troops in South Korea, a military legacy from the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended with an uneasy armistice.Analysts say the real danger amid the current tensions may come if North Korean ships decide to test the South Korean blockade, running the risk of provoking another conflict at sea. In what may be an effort to warn the North Koreans away from such a confrontation, the Pentagon has said the U.S. Navy would join South Korea's navy in anti-submarine-warfare exercises ""in the near future.""Given North Korea's bellicose statements so far, it's not clear how its military would react in a confrontation at sea.""I think everybody's trying to get the mix just right,"" says Thomas Hubbard, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea. ""To have measures that are strong enough to teach a lesson, but not so strong as to create a retaliatory cycle.""Will Sanctions Hurt North Korea?North Korea exports minerals, such as construction sand, and some farm products to the South. The loss of that trade could amount to more than $250 million a year. That's relatively tiny by the standards of most industrial countries, but because the North is so impoverished, experts say the loss will be felt.EnlargeJung Yeon-je/AFP/Getty ImagesA South Korean protester burns a North Korean flag with an image of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il during a rally in Seoul on Tuesday. South Korea has imposed trade sanctions on the North for alleged sinking a southern naval vessel.""That's enough to have an impact on North Korea's economy,"" says analyst Jack Pritchard, ""but it won't be a decisive impact."" Even so, Pritchard, the president of the Korea Economic Institute in Washington, says the sanctions are ""a necessary step"" to express South Korean anger over the attack.Pritchard says the South's action leaves North Korea in a weaker position, with little trade beyond what it has with its major trading partner, China.North Korea's trade with the South was a source of foreign exchange currency, which the North then used to buy items such as fuel and machinery from China, commodities that are especially important to the North's large military.But the trade situation between the North and South has been deteriorating over the more than two years that Lee has been in office, says Charles Armstrong, director of the center for Korean studies at Columbia University.A former executive at Hyundai Corp., Lee is a conservative politician who has taken a tougher line on North Korea than several of his predecessors. Trade between the two countries fell by an estimated 10 percent last year.China Steps InArmstrong notes that China already has wide investments in North Korea, and he says it will probably take up much of the slack caused by the South Korean trade cutoff. Both China and South Korea view the North as an important source of low-cost labor.One major exception to the trade cutoff is the Kaesong industrial complex, an area in North Korea where more than a dozen South Korean companies have built or are building manufacturing plants to be staffed by North Korean workers.Activity at the Kaesong complex amounts to more than half the trade between the two countries.It's already a significant source of income for the North, where workers are believed to earn a total of more than $40 million a year in hard currency wages. South Korean economists believe it could eventually employ more than 700,000 North Korean workers.Hubbard says South Korea would be reluctant to shut the project down. ""More than trade, [the South Koreans] see this as laying the basis for future relations,"" Hubbard says.He adds that if the Kaesong complex were shut down, the loss of jobs would very likely stir a strong public reaction that even the North Korean leadership would have to pay attention to.One thing that's not clear to economists is how much criminal activity contributes to North Korea's economy.According to the U.S. State Department, North Korea ""is also thought to earn hundreds of millions of dollars from the unreported sale of missiles, narcotics and counterfeit cigarettes and currency."""

FAML	I don't think my daughter has ADHD	"My daughter is five, she's in preschool for a speech delay, that's almost gone. At the last parent meeting the teachers brought up some ""issues"" that i don't really think are a problem. When its time for stations, if my daughter wants to do a certain one, but they want her to do a different one first she gets upset. Or when she's in speech and they're playing a game, once her turn is over she kinda turns and finds something else to do till it is her turn again. She's not hyper active or anything like that, i just think its her personality. I also think maybe its just that she's five. I don't have a huge problem with her at home, the biggest thing is we cut sugar, cause that makes her a little crazy. Any advice, or thoughts would be helpful. Just kinda want to know if anyone elses five year old is kinda the same."

SOCL	Rich got richer during the recovery, and rest got poorer	"http://lifeinc.today.com/_news/2013/04/23/17880268-rich-got-richer-during-the-recovery-and-rest-got-poorer-study-says?lite""The nationÃ¢ € ™s richest American households generally gained wealth during the first two years of the economic recovery, a new research report finds, while most American households saw their net worth drop.The report, released Tuesday by the Pew Research Center, found that the mean net worth for the 7 percent of American households at the top of the wealth distribution rose by 28 percent between 2009 and 2011, the most recent data available.Meanwhile, the mean net worth for the other 93 percent of American households fell by 4 percent during that period, according to PewÃ¢ € ™s analysis of Census data.Overall, the aggregate net worth for all American households rose between 2009 and 2011. But PewÃ¢ € ™s more detailed analysis showed that the gains were concentrated among the wealthiest Americans, and the wealth gap increased during that time.Economists say thatÃ¢ € ™s a continuation of a trend toward more wealth being found at the top of the income scale.Ã¢ € œThereÃ¢ € ™s been a growing concentration of wealth in this country for quite a while now, and itÃ¢ € ™s just really accelerated in the last, really, 15 years,Ã¢ €  said Joel Naroff, chief economist with Naroff Economic Advisors, who was not involved in the Pew study.The Great Recession officially ran from December of 2007 to June of 2009, but the recovery since that time has been weak and uneven.The Pew researchers said rallies in stocks and bonds, which benefited affluent households with major investments, largely drove the discrepancy in wealth gains during those two years.The housing market, where many other Americans derive a lot of their wealth, did not do that well during that period.The Pew researchers said they focused on the top 7 percent of the wealth distribution because that was the tabulation available from the Census data. The report found that the mean net wealth for those 8 million households rose to around $3.17 million in 2011, from approximately $2.48 million in 2009.For the other approximately 111 million households, mean net worth fell to nearly $134,000 in 2011, from nearly $140,000 in 2009.The reportÃ¢ € ™s authors note that some less-wealthy American households no doubt saw wealth gains during the period. In general, however, more of the households in that 93 percent saw their wealth fall rather than rise.Naroff noted that income distribution is always shifting in one way or another, but the wealth gap has grown especially wide in recent years. That could pose problems for an economy that is largely driven by consumer spending.Ã¢ € œWe havenÃ¢ € ™t seen it at least in 100 years as heavily distributed to the upper income side as weÃ¢ € ™re seeing now, and we donÃ¢ € ™t know whether that pattern is readily reversed,Ã¢ €  he said. Ã¢ € œAnd if itÃ¢ € ™s not reversed what happens to the economy thatÃ¢ € ™s built on a consumer base? ThatÃ¢ € ™s the uncertainty that we have.Ã¢ € I was going to add this onto Ms. P's banking thread but I thought it deserved its own."
GOAL	floaters and cloudy vision following eye migraine	Eight days ago I started having white flashes and floaters appear in my right eye which my Dr. said are from a (painless) migraine of the eye.    My vision is blurry like I'm looking through murky water and the floaters are long squiggly lines.    I understand that floaters take a long time to settle down.    I don't mind the floaters as much as the blurred vision.    Has anyone had this type of migraine and do you know what triggered it?    My Dr. said I probably won't have this problem in my left eye but how does he know that?    I would be legally blind if it happens to my other eye.

FAML	Sudden change in 3yr old behaviour	Just into the second week in January this year, our little granddaughter aged 3 returned home from an overnight stay with her father.    We met up with our daughter within the hour as we had arranged to go out for a meal with them.    On seeing them I noted that our little granddaughters hair did not looked brushed and she looked shattered.    She greeted me as she always does with open arms and a big kiss then she begun to cry.    All evening she was very subdued, pale, and then she called mum at the table 'stinky' 'you are stinky'.    This is not a term we use at all, especially directed at anyone and in such a tone.    I babysat her that week on the Mon, Wed and thurs.    All three nights were very distressing.    Refusing to do anything and everything.    hand in mouth.    hiding under the stairs looking very frightened to come out.    Hiding under the breakfast bar on the wednesday, and crying, and looking scared and wary and then after a long period of about 30 mins would break down.    Apologising, for being bad.    Saying sorry when it isn't appropriate.    Lashing out and kicking, refusing to get undressed at bedtime, in the mornings refusing to get dressed.     Speaking in an ugly manner and shouting.    Screwing up her face during all of this.    Throwing her bedtime books all over the floor.    Refusing bedtime stories.     not letting us brush her hair, pushing the mirror off the dressing table. don't this and don't want that. Pointing into my face and her own and then pointing between her legs,    when I offered no response she did it again, her expression was hard to read.    I told her I didn't understand.    She just run off.     Being aggressive with the pets, we have a dog and a cat.    Being aggressive with us.On the following Sat we had tickets to go see sleeping beauty.    She has been before.    On this occasion her spark had gone.    Gone from being a happy animated child to a zombie.This all happened within one week.    The second and third week was just as eventful.    We contacted gateway, a social welfare network for protecting children.    They     advised no contact with the father and that it would be investigated.    4 weeks later they sent a very young girl to assess our little granddaughter, she only has had one, one hr assessment to date.    By this time Emma was having good spells.    Meantime the fathers father, took mum to court to resume access, despite mum explaining to father,    the    change in her behaviour.    The judge held mum in contempt of court, and a summons would be issued if she stopped contact, and jail.     The report provided by the social worker from gateway summed it up as borderline and basically made it look like its just a petty feud between parents.     Visitation was reinstated.    My daughter begged for supervision.    Supervision was granted by the court but only by any member of his family.    Which defeated the purpose of the whole supervision request.     The whole experience has been gutt wrenching.    Our solicitor did not prepare us for anything.    When the application for court was received by the fathers solicitor, the only advice he could offer was that that was foolish for them to do that and that we would just have to go with it.We have contacted a psychologist.    Privately.    We have changed Solicitors.We have so far felt let down by the system.     I can understand now how children can be open to abuse as the lack of interest in the social care is amazing.    This is now March and still no more word about assessments which was promised.    Also they said that there would be no access while assessments were done.    However, when court contacted them by phone the social worker who did the one assessment, felt that the father posed no threat.    Based on one visit.Our granddaughter has changed dramatically, lost her confidence, her spark, her warm loving embraces are now few.    Since visitation started back last Saturday the drama has returned..There have been 2 visits since the court date.    On both those dates on returning our grandddaughter displays alot of aggression, hatred, namecalling and lashing out.Does this really sound like a family feud?     If my spelling and grammar have deteriorated its because I am weary.Mother is so much distressed too she doesn't know where to turn, she is started counselling with lifeline, to keep her head throughout this ordeal.I do know that creche say she talks about us all the time.    Fondly about all the antics we get up to.    They report this daily to us.    I know she does this at her fathers or wherever she goes.    But oddly we never hear anything much from her about fathers side of the family about what she does.     A member of staff at the creche did disclose to me that she has only mentioned her Dads name recently.My question is this.     What help is there out there for us.    Will the psychologist shine some light?    She is only 3.    Will the court allow her to interview the father?    This is so important.    This is a plea, a prayer, to stop what is evidently destroying a beautiful being.    If there is anything else we should know, or can do, please help.This discussion is related toSudden behavior changes in 3 year old.

DISE	spacey head all the time	Hello all,About 18 months ago I woke up with what appeared to be symtoms(symptoms)of a night for lack of sleep.After several days it didnt seem to go away, and I still have the spacey detached feeling, onlyworse now. I have been to an ENT, had hearing tested and was fine, along with pressure testing.Left ear always has a full feeling, eustachian tube never seems to want to clear. Headaches attimes, behind left eyeball, and other parts of the head, but always on the left side. Went to adentist for TMJ screening because I have some Jaw    clicking on the left side. Dentist didnt makeany determinations at this piont. My main concern is the lofty head feeling, and lack of concentration.If it gets any worse I wont be able to function at all. I also dont have insurance so it makes itmuch more frustrating and costly to get even some answers. Any thought are welcome, thanks
PREG	Weeks???? Lunar.. gestational I don't understand!!	My doctor says I am just over 12 weeks counting from the LMP. So if this is true when does my first trimester end?
GOAL	AMD plus black circles	Hi my mum suffers from AMD. Since 2006 she has been troubled with seeing two large black 'circles' when she opens her eyes upon waking in a morning. These are not ordinary 'floaters', she says they are the size of a 2 pence piece. She only experiences these whilst laying down, and now says that she gets them after having been in bed only a short while (ie, before she has actually fallen asleep and woken up). If she opens her eyes they are sometimes grey and far away, sometimes they become 'closer' and darker. Once she has opened her eyes and is aware of them, and then shuts her eyes the circles appear white.Sometimes she says she experiences a kind of 'shutter ' sensation like a camera. I know my description may not be perfect but can anyone help diagnose what is wrong with my mum? She has been to the optician, who says it isnt an opthalmic problem because if she shuts one eye she can still see the circles. She has been to see a specialist at her GP's referral who also does not know what is wrong with her. Please help?
PREG	BFP!!!! Question	"I posted yesterday that I had tested late in the afternoon and got a BFP. Well, I tested again this morning and got another BFP.

GOAL	LASIK resulting in binocular diplopia	"It seems that my LASIK in 1999 resulted in binocular diplopia. I started fairly nearsighted both eyes    (-7) with strabismus of the left eye (outward).    (Eye muscle surgery at 9 only for cosmetic purposes; never wore prisms).    Initially went farsighted after LASIK to approx. +2 and started to see 2 after 6 weeks.    After about 2 years and working with my new eye surgeon we finally realized that the position of my eyes changed and my strabismus eye was now going cross-eyed, thus the seeing 2.    A total of 7 surgeries later between the 2 eyes with the most recent 6 weeks ago, my problem has signficantly improved.    Again, the better my ""good eye"" sees, the less I see 2.    My strabismus eye had been corrected back to -1 a few years ago and this off balance with my good eye seemed to be the final step in fixing my problem.    (To add to the problem, I was now at reading glasses stage and I essentially ended up with monovision.    And monovision does not work when you have strabismus so that caused yet another problem)    That is, my surgeon performed LASIK on the eye to correct the -1 and my off balance feeling is gone and my eyes seem to be back to their old (albeit 8 years ago) position.    So essentially, my initial LASIK resulted in a change in eye position and the battle of the eye muscles.Is this something that has become an issue with LASIK (apparently at that time no Dr. had heard of this and I saw many Dr's!)."

Slowly but surely we started to fall for each other and after months and months of discussion, decided to date. At first it worked so well,the friendship that meshed with the romance was a lovely combination. But as of late its felt like the friendship aspect has dwindeld...and is replaced by what I assumed where comfortable scilences.but the more often they happen the more I can feel the scilence becoming ...too aparent. The conversation has become shorter and more surface level,the deep discussions seem forced.we care and love each other,and breaking up seems rash. I'm just looking for a way to get the conversation back and flowing.I want my best friend back,yet I want the love there too...any ideas?

FAML	I can't get my 3yo toilet trained or to stop talking to his food	My 3 and a half year old was born 13 weeks early.    Only had CPAP help - no ventilator as he could breath on his own.'He is a very, very bright - intelligent, happy child; a normal 3 year old.    Except for a couple of things.    He won't be toilet trained - especially for number 2's.    He will sit on the toilet - has no problems there and will do wee's -    but nothing more.    He won't wear undies - he told me this morning he doesn't like the feel of them on his 'bits'.    Prefers the nappy.    I am intending to buy him some boxer shorts to see how he goes with them.He has also taken to talking to his food at dinner time.    He's fine with breakfast and lunch - but dinner time - it's all play mostly.    Particularly with vegetables, he makes up stories with them....dances them around his plate, plays 'families' with them, builds 'towers' and cars etc with it.    He also has a' thing' for round food.    Loves the feel of round food and will not eat meat unless it's minced or chopped into the tiniest pieces.We are at a loss as to what to do about both problems.    He is easily distracted when out and about - but when something interests him he fixes on it and you cannot distract him at all.    He's a fantastic mimic and has a great memory.    He's more advanced than his 4 and half year old brother with numbers, letters, arty stuff and he's trying hard to read.    He is very very intelligent and extremely polite - but has no sense of the 'regular'.    Cannot get him to do a task - says 'no thank you, I dont like to do that'.Any advice appreciated
SOCL	Please help!!	I've been feeling absolutely exhausted for the past six weeks now, and no matter how much sleep I get, it doesn't go away. On top of that I have extremely achey(achy)joints and muscles, and I feel very weak. I get short of breath frequently, and seem to have a constant cold and sore throat which I can't get rid of. This has begun to affect my school work as I just cannot concentrate or get motivated. What could this be?
PREG	Progesterone Level is 17 on CD24?	I have been taking Clomid 50mg for 2 cycles.    My Dr. called today and said my progesterone level on Day 24 was 17.    Last month on day 23 it was 22.8.    She said I probably ovulated and could be pregnant.    Has anyone been in a similar situation?    I am a little scared that it dropped from last month and am not feeling very hopeful about this month.    I would really appreciate any advice.
FAML	clingy girl	Hi my almost 5 year old daughter has recently been very sad, moody and clingy.    She is sad when she wakes up.    When I take her to school she is sad and most days starts to tear up when i leave and tell me that she wants me.    And she is sad when i pick her up from school.    Her teachers have also told me that she is sad throughout the day and continually needs hugs.She never used to be like this.    She was happy when i took her to school and was in a good mood generally most of the time.    i am not sure if this is an attention seeking behaviour or if I generally need to be concerned.    Sometimes I feel like I need to take her to coucilling to see what is really wrong with her.    My husband and I are getting very frustrated with her because it seems like no matter what she has or what we do with her she is mopey and sad.Any suggestions for a frustrated and concerned mum?Thanks,frustrated_mum

A urine catheter was then put on to him with IV antibiotics(Meropenem) for 2 weeks.10. Pediatric Surgeon said MCU is suspicious of PU valves.11. As per suggestion of a Pediatric Surgeon he underwent through a PU (Posterior Urethral valves) fulguration through cystoscopy on 11th Jan.12. He is kept on Magnex IV antibiotic for 6 post operative days along with the urinary catheter.13. After a week catheter was removed. He was given Taxim-o oral antibiotic twice a day.14. After one week of oral antibiotic unfortunately he again shows multiple pus cells in his urine report and again the same organism E-coli can be seen.16. He is now again on 14 day IV antibiotic.15.

If fever doesn't go down he is suggested to have an urine catheter again to release the urine bladder pressure.Not sure as how to proceed

DISE	Going for TVUS tomorrow - scared.	Hello,I have not been diagnosed yet with anything but my gyn is sending me for a TVUS tomorrow after months of pain and crazy symptoms.    I am 27, turning 28 next month.Starting back in March, I had intense pelvic pain that came and went (very sharpÃ¢ € ”thought it might be appendicitis but then it went away a couple of hours later and I didnÃ¢ € ™t seek treatment for it).    Over the next few months, just very tired, intermittent random sharp pains on right side, sometimes low in the pelvic area other times higher up by my rib cage, bloated, feel disgusting after eating, cramps and diarrhea, sometimes pain during intercourseÃ¢ € ¦does not seem to have any obvious triggers.    Pain was very bad one night in July, woke me up in the middle of the night, and husband took me to the ERÃ¢ € ¦they tested me for appendicitis and kidney stones with at cat scan, everything came back okay, but they told me I had a tumor on my liver and to follow up with PCP.    PCP did liver function blood tests and sent me for an MRI (all the while telling me that he thinks I have IBS but he needs to rule out everything else before making that official diagnosis).    Blood work came back normal, MRI showed liver hemangioma which doc says could not be causing my pain and I should not worry about it, but will have to have another MRI done in a year to make sure it has not changed at all.    The entire month of July I felt sick every single day, husband and I took a weekend trip to Chicago, on the ride there I thought we might have to pull over and find a hospital because the pain in my lower back and right side was so intense and I felt very sick (lightheaded, nauseous).    Symptoms came and went.    PCP told me to see my gyn.    Saw gyn, did pap (came back fine), pelvic exam, she said everything felt ok during pelvic exam, but I was in a lot of pain during it, especially when she pressed on area right below where she said my ovaries are.    She ordered the TVUS which I am having done tomorrow.    She seemed generally unconcerned about my symptoms due to my age.Two weeks ago I started having chest pains, shooting pain in my neck and shoulders (have had this issue before, last year, PCP sent me to a cardiologist who did a full work up and told me I was fine but I might or might not have small vessel disease, so basically he told me nothing) and went to the ER where I had an episode while hooked up the monitor heart rate went up to 180 in about a minute while I was just sitting there, felt like I was going to pass out, doctor and nurses ran in, stuck an oxygen tube up my nose, gave me meds through IV to stop me from shaking, the whole thing was extremely scary.    They admitted me to the hospital, kept me on heart monitor, did blood work, and an echocardiogram, told me I am suffering from SVT episodes and put me on a daily beta blocker (which drops by bp low so now I have to worry about not passing out).    Released me after 3 nights, now I have a follow up appointment on nov 1st with the cardiologist.    Beta blockers seem to be helping so far, just have to watch my bp and make sure I keep my fluid intake up and eat enough.I was just getting over the SVT hospital stay when last week, on Wednesday night, I woke up with intense pain on my LEFT side, low abdomen area, not quite ovarian area, more to the outer left side.    Was shaky and sweaty, husband took me to the ER.    Told them I was ordered a pelvic u/s by my gyn that I had not had yet, they told me it was too late at night for the u/s, so the doctor (who was male and seemed dismissive) sent me for a cat scan to look for kidney stones, which came back fine, but they said they found a little bacteria in urine and I had a slight UTI (doctors exact words were very dismissively Ã¢ € œI donÃ¢ € ™t know what that is about, weÃ¢ € ™ll give you some antibiotics).    Gave me antibiotics through IV, discharged me, husband had to pull over on the way home from hospital because the meds made me sick.    Oh and the ER nurse also blew out my vein while trying to take blood (went and got a 2nd nurse who did it fine without any problems).    Needless to say that ER visit was a nightmare.So now IÃ¢ € ™m sitting at my desk at work with dull constant pain on the RIGHT side, thinking to myself that itÃ¢ € ™s probably nothing (since that is what they tell me at the ER usually) but also I worry, Ã¢ € œwell what if one of these times it IS my appendix and I ignore it?Ã¢ € All of this these past six months has been extremely emotionally draining.    The pelvic/abdominal pain is scary enough, and so frustrating that I do not have a diagnosis, and now also dealing with the SVT and heart episodes.    My job has not been understanding and basically told me if I didnÃ¢ € ™t apply for FMLA I would be fired.    My husband has been great and very supportive, but I know he feels the burden too of all of this and trys to be strong for me.I donÃ¢ € ™t know what I want to happen tomorrowÃ¢ € ”IÃ¢ € ™m almost hoping that the TVUS finds something so that I have an answer as to what is causing all of these problems.    On the other hand, I donÃ¢ € ™t want it to find anything.    Hopefully if it does find something it isnÃ¢ € ™t something too serious (cysts) and can be treated easily.    I know that ovca is rare in women my age (at least that is what people tell me).    If it finds nothing then I have to see a GI specialist and undergo more tests.    I just want answers, tired of not being taken seriously, tired of missing time from work, tired of worrying, tired of doctors and hospitals, tired of feeling like I'm nuts.     Every day I have some sort of pain, whether it is dull and achy, sharp and stabbing, etc.    IÃ¢ € ™m so scared that someday IÃ¢ € ™m just going to drop dead because I have some condition that has gone undiagnosed.Thanks for listening.    Wondering if any of you ladies had any similar experiences or pain like mine, or if any of you are around my age?
DEMO	Period Issues	I am 18, and from age 11 1/2 I have experienced normal, timely periods lasting 4 days. About a year and a half ago I took birth control for acutane. I have been off birth control for almost a year now, and the first three months afterward I had normal periods. Then they got progressively father apart and suddenly lighter. My last period took 7 weeks from my last, and started with light brown discharge that was very thick. As it went on it did appear more normal but was still very light. Anyone know if this is something I should be worried about?
TRMT	question about artificial sweeteners	"I have realized I am EXTREMELY sensitive to artificial sweeteners but also on a low calorie diet (I know what a curse, huh?) and have been digging up all the reaseach I can on them.found a site called www.splendaexposed.com that pretty much runs the gamut""Artificial sweeteners: This category of non-nutritive, high-intensity sugar substitutes includes ASPARTAME, ACESULFAME-K, NEOTAME, SUCRALOSE, and ALITAME""now I read this quote on the site""The two safest choices of sweeteners to date are saccharin and stevia. Yes, saccharin! Saccharin is actually similar to stevia in its origin.    It originally came from a plant imported from China, and in its original form, is a complex sugar extract from the plant itself.    Stevia is extracted from a plant grown in South America, and is also a complex sugar extract.""I did not know this about saccharin (sweet and low). Saccharin was the first type of artificial sweetener developed all the way back in 1878.Can anyone confirm/has anyone heard that it is in the same category, safety-wise, as stevia?? I had never heard this    The info is from the above site and comes from a book called ""Splenda: Is it Safe or Not?"" by Dr. Janet Starr Hull.thanks"

I have had 2 ultrasound to confirm the baby has a heart beat.I have had 3 pregnancys and 3 live births.I know there is something not right but when doctors are telling you not to worry that is what bothers me i am afraid to let my guard down and not worry that its a misscarriage only because if it turns out to be one i dont think i can handle that.i have went to 2 hospitals for different opions on this but they all say the same thing that if it is a miscarriage there is nothing they can do in whick i do understand that but what if there is something that can be controlled. I am so annoyed with that fact that no one    cares i think that that is rediculous because my baby has a heartbeat!

FAML	Son (6) middle-right abdominal pain since Sunday AM	"My son has been complaining of abdominal pain since Sunday morning. I let it go Sunday thinking maybe a pulled muscle or some gas or something. All day Sunday he was holding his tummy. Laying around and like ""limping"" with it. It hurt when he sneezed, coughed, getting out of a chair, out of bed, etc. Felt like he couldn't bend over or anything. He needed help. Had no fever, nothing else abnormal.Mon still going on. I called our insurance plan nurse and she suggested taking him to urgent care. We got there and the nurse decided ER . Doc came in and I told him everything. they took blood/urine and strep swab and all came out normal.Xrays showed full bowels which honestly has been an ongoing problem for him, but was always relieved by laxatives. HOWEVER, he has bowel movements normally and is not constipated. Most of the time, they are long, soft stools (normal).The doc then said ""we get a very small pic from an xray - and this certainly could be early signs of appendicitis - so you need to keep an eye on him and watch for high fever and/or vomiting"". Now, he has definately had a lack of appetite. He is drinking fluids just fine as well.Today he was the same. Holding his right side but still sent him off to school. He said it is his middle and lower right side that hurts. But he still can walk around the house (while holding his belly) with a smile on his face and playing a little bit but certainly not running around and bending over any.I've been scouring the internet for other possible causes. He's had two bowel movements since Sunday with no problems and with no relief of pain in belly.What scares me is COULD THIS BE his appendix beginning to act up and possibly burst? Without all the classic symptoms? Should I demand more testing? We do go see his pediatrician on Monday for a follow up, but should I wait that long?Any advice is appreciated. Thank you."
SOCL	Bleeding after sex	Hi, my boyfriend and i are both turning 18 closer to the end of the year, we have been together for 25 months now and have been having sex for roughly 1 year and a half. Everything has always been fine everytime, even the first time, which was the first time for both of us, went perfectly, I bled a little bit but not much at all. But the last two times we had sex, I was bleeding a little bit afterwards, not heavy and not for long, but it still makes me worry. He thinks I should go to the doctors about it, but the doctors I go to are of a different race and are very strict about no sex until after marriage, so I know I wouldn't feel comfortable talking to them about it, and my mum and I aren't that close, so that leaves me with no one else to talk to about it.. Can someone please help me? If its serious, or could be, I want to know as soon as possible so I can do something about it quicker.
PREG	Seizure Disorder's impact on sleeping habits	My 3 year old has a seizure disorder and is on lots of medicine.    She typically has her seizures at night.    She gets her meds between 5 and 6 every evening followed by a bath around 7ish and bed by 8.    Our dillemia is that we know that if she is sleep deprivated it can bring the seizures on, but she doesn't like to go to bed.    We have relaxed our routine and allow her to go to bed later (9 or later), but it is always a fight, which usually results in kicking and screaming and then falling off to sleep followed by a seizure.    In comes the guilt and dismay we feel.    What can we do?    Is there some connection between her being tired, but refusing to go to sleep and her seizure disorder?

I've been too embarrased to ask a docter or anyone else if this is normal but from what I've seen in adult videos (which I acknowledge are not that credible) it does not seem too be, so should I see a doctor for this or is it normal?
FAML	MY 8 YEAR PEES AND SAYS HE DOESNT KNOW	My 8 year old son wets his pants 5-7 times a week. He does not tell anyone when this happens, I will happen to smell him or notice his pants are wet. My son has ADHD and is on Medication and I have taken him to the Dr. and she insist that he is only constipated. He has been taking medicine to help his bowels and continues to have accidents. Should I be looking for a second opinion? Will this pass with age?    Please Help, Thank you
SOCL	House Passes Bill Against the Use of Restraints in School? Opinions?	I understand there is some concern about further government regulations in general. I myself would tend to believe that when schools overstep the boundaries of parents and take action against students that is not just discipline but potential physical abuse that should be outlawed but people might have their own concerns. This site appears in support of it and it is from the Republican legislature:http://www.gop.gov/bill/111/1/hr4247This is the text of the bill itself:http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-4247Since some people may have children who could be affected or know people who are I thought I would post this and people could decide what their opinion is.
FAML	4 year old with obsessive fixations	My 4 year old boy has had this behavior for over a year now, and while it my hope was that it was transient, as the behavior seemed to wane over time, over the last week or so it has come back with a vengeance. At breakfast, lunch, or dinner, he will find a piece of food that to him looks like something, for example a tortilla chip that may coincidentally have the silhouette of an animal. He will then demand to keep it, and will then stow it away somewhere where it will invariably be forgotten. Normally I would find this sort of thing cute and imaginative, however recently it has been nonstop, to the point that he will not eat as much as he should. He will simply 'see' something he thinks is cute in his food and refuse to eat it.Any intervention, such as taking the piece of food away will result in an epic tantrum. If this were something we observed once in a while, we would likely think nothing of it. But it happens over and over and over throughout the day, to the point where we question the possibility of an obsessive disorder.As it happens, the onset of this more recent bout of tantrums coincided roughly with us taking him off zyrtec, an allergy medication, as i read that it could cause issues with kids. He had been on it for months and months, every night, at the instruction of his allergist. He would still be taking it if I hadnt done a bit of research about its possible negative pediatric side effects. It also coincided with his return to school, after winter break. Before break started however, he had his hand broken by another kid at school, and had a cast, hand therapy, etc... the resultant drama at school was a bit much. If our child has obsessive issues coming from anxiety, then im sure all of this going on at his school didnt help.We did have him evaluated over a year ago because of some attention issues at school, and ruled out things like autism or asperger's at that time. Their conclusion was that he has sensory issues, and as a result we had him in occupational therapy, which I am still somewhat confused about.Anyway, while this post doesnt really paint the whole picture, my hope is that someone out there recognizes might have some insight. Does any of this sound normal? I think the best case scenario would be that he is a spirited child, has eccentricities, will grow up just fine, and we're worrying way too much about it. That is my hunch, but just observing how little energy my wife has at the end of the day, i am concerned that there is something wrong. Anyone?
GOAL	Eating well and NOT losing weight	"I weigh approximately 205lbs, and am 40 years old.    I have been overweight now for about 17 years (the age of my oldest child...) and decided that I can no longer stand to be this heavy.    I am 5'4"", and I would like to weigh about 125-ish.    My issue is this:    I am a classic undereater who tends to binge because I'm starving.    The binging may have only been once a week.. or twice a week, but apparently it was enough to keep me in this state of ""fat"".Since deciding to journal my food intake over a month ago, I have noticed that I barely break the 1200 calorie mark almost every day.    Keep in mind I am not trying to starve.. I am eating what I consider to be healthy; a lot of fresh veggies, and a lot of lean protein with a few healthy carbs mixed in.    I haven't had but maybe one sugary or fatty snack in over a month.This is a typical day for me:Breakfast:2 egg whites or 1 boiled egg, pear/apple, coffee or waterLunch:2-3 small cucumbersGarden salad with 2-3 Tbs. of dressingTuna (1 can or pouch) plain1 can (2 servings) of Healthy Choice SoupDinner:This will vary, but often does not exceed 300 caloriesI am averaging 1100-1200 calories a day, and for the life of me cannot understand why such a deficiency isn't creating more of a weight loss.    I understand that at my weight, in order to maintain 200+lbs, I should consume approx. 2700 calories/day.    I have now restricted drastically with little to no results.    In my estimation, I should be losing at least 3lbs a week.    I have also been moderately exercising when my work schedule allows.    Can anyone tell me what I am doing wrong?    I am making healthy food choices, and cutting calories.    This with added exercise for nearly a month should be fairly effective, but it's not.    What am I doing wrong?"
SOCL	Is this normal?	The first time I had sex almost a month ago, we didn't use any condoms or anything. He got in for 5mins or 6, then we saw blood on the bed. And we both got worried, though we didn't think about it that much.. Last week, we did it again without any condoms, but I started having light bleeding again, but it was only half way through, and we were having a hard time getting it in like the first time. Was that normal? Please help me, I am really worried!
DISE	Roberta post re: tachy	The following post I found on google.com when I looked up hypertension and tachycardia, and it was amazing, because what this lady's daughter is going through is exactly what I have been going through.    It all started shortly after I had a baby, her daughter is also the same age.    I has been noted that adrenalin seems to possibly be the cause of my tachy, but my adrenals have not been checked.SamPosted by CCF CARDIO MD - DLB on March 23, 1999 at 10:55:06:In Reply to: Hyperbeta adrenergic syndrome posted by Roberta on March 22, 1999 at 14:41:03:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------: Can anyone help me to understand this diagnosis which was given to my daughter after many tests and different treatments for tachycardia? I am under the understanding that she does not have a heart problem but her body does not compensate to stress as a normal body does so her heart rate stays elevated. Her problem semed to start after childbirth but over a long period of time became really bad to where she looked emanciated. She has gained weight since being on beta blockers and is also on antidepressants but sometimes she seems to loose her train of thought and we worry that all this medication is putting her in a worse predicament. She is 29yrs old and has not cut out her smoking 100% Is it possible that the cigarets are causing all her problems in the first place? Also I feel like she could possibly be manic depressive because she seems to go from a real high to a desperate low and lashes out at anyone in her path. I realize she feels bad and tired a lot but I would like to kow how to help her. Thank you for any insight.

GOAL	diagnosed with VKH	"I posted a rather lengthy explanation of my history on April 10th and was answered by Dr. Michael Kutryb who suggested my seeing the best opthamologist in my area.    I have an appointment with an opthamologist later this month, but may cancel in order to try to see another who is probably one of the best in St Louis.    This doctor was recommended by a neurologist whom I saw today.    He diagnosed me with VKH, Vogt Koyanagi Harada syndrome or disease, after a VERY brief consultation.    I am not sure that he even looked at my medical history.    I was somewhat in shock and was confused with this diagnosis, especially since    he came up with it so quickly.    After looking it up online, I am even more confused since I do not have the skin and hair symptoms.    He assured me that he is a very good doctor and knows what he is talking about and was very convincing. Either that is true or he is psychic or a miracle worker!    I will take a ""Miracle"" at this point. My question is related to the fact that he said that it is not a neurological problem.    What I have read seems to indicate that there can be neurological aspects or complications.    I have worried that the chronic inflammation that I have been experiencing for so long may be causing some kind of nerve damage.    I have both visual and mental disorientation. I have not driven a car for almost two years.    The opthamologist that I have been seeing for the past few years has never mentioned uveitis.    Do I dare to hope that I may be finally getting some answers?This discussion is related toCould my eyes have been contaminated?."

GOAL	Bit my tongue...is it infected?	I bit my tongue two days ago...now it is hurting in the place of the bite as there is a huge white canker sore at the same place I bit it...also on the same side, there seems to be 3 or 4 bumps on my tongue about 1 cm away fromthe bite. There is no puss coming out though. Is my tongue infected?Also, I bit my tongue while having lunch, then at night after about 10 hours I felt a pain in my neck under the jaw on the same side of the bite...The next day I woke up and the pain in my neck/throat was worse and I couldnt swallow easily. Now it is easing a bit. Is this related to the biting incident?
PREG	IUI procedure questions... newbie here.  What to expect? Any advice?	Hi all, amazing & inspiring site & response.    I can feel the comfort of support from this site.    I just wanted to share with you all that I am trying my 1st IUI treatment.    They are currently analyzing all the hormones, my fiance's blood, urine as well sperm.    He's had several tests prior to meeting with fertility clinic. They just wanted to make sure they knew how much they had to work with.    I love this fertility clinic.    We only pay if they complete proceedure.    If they find for it to be a non satisfactory cycle for either, they will not go ahead with IUI that month, they will wait for the next. Nice to have some honest ppl around for change.    No guarentees this we know of, as we've heared some get lucky the first time, other takes several attempts, and other does not work for them at all.    Our fertility is still unexplained so far.    Tubes are wide open, well left side is, cause caused it to spaz when I had tubes check with blue dye proceedure.Any advice ladies or gentlemen, before proceeding witih IUI?    We've been trying for over 1.1/2 yrs now with no success naturally.    I did have a thyroid issue, wich is now regulated by hormone pills, that are taken daily, maybe that had a definate effect on why we've been unsuccessful.    We've tried 3 rounds of clomid, very basic dose 50mg, however I'm told the higher you go the more chances of multiples. I'll be happy with one, however two would definately make a new spin on things. I'm a mother of 1.    I had her 11 yrs ago.    I know quite the age gap, however she's not my fiance's.    In fact my fiance for him would be his first.    I want so badly to make him a father, he's looking forward to being a father soon.Anything we can do to help the proceedure? Both he or I?    Any advice is definitely appreciated & welcome.    We are newbies to this IUI process.My fiance is 33, I'm 32.Both healthy, no other complications or illness.My daughter was born very healthy, a bit smaller however that was due to Toxemia & being 2 weeks early.Oh, anyone know what the chances are of another C-Section if first was one?Or can I have a normal birth with taring?Ã¢ ™ ¥ Baby dust to you...

SOCL	Impulsive Behavior?	Recently I dated someone with extreme political views. She dumped me after one month for someone she met on the internet and has been skyping and communicating with online for only 3 weeks. She has decided to enter a relationship with him, go to Ireland, sight unseen, and spend time with him. She also added that her mother was a diagnosed schizophrenic and her son has recently been diagnosed with Bipolar I disorder. Naturally, I feel manipulated but am also gravely concerned for her. I am not a mental health expert but her behavior seems extremely impulsive and irrational, not to mention a little needy. Any suggestions as to what she might be un-diagnosed with?Thanks. I am concerned for her.
SOCL	Under Obama, U.S. Govt. Spends At Lowest Rate In Decades	http://articles.marketwatch.com/2012-05-22/commentary/31802270_1_spending-federal-budget-drunken-sailorWASHINGTON (MarketWatch) Ã¢ € ” Of all the falsehoods told about President Barack Obama, the biggest whopper is the one about his reckless spending spree.As would-be president Mitt Romney tells it: Ã¢ € œI will lead us out of this debt and spending inferno.Ã¢ € Almost everyone believes that Obama has presided over a massive increase in federal spending, an Ã¢ € œinfernoÃ¢ €  of spending that threatens our jobs, our businesses and our childrenÃ¢ € ™s future. Even Democrats seem to think itÃ¢ € ™s true.But it didnÃ¢ € ™t happen. Although there was a big stimulus bill under Obama, federal spending is rising at the slowest pace since Dwight Eisenhower brought the Korean War to an end in the 1950s.Even hapless Herbert Hoover managed to increase spending more than Obama has.Here are the facts, according to the official government statistics:Ã¢ € ¢ In the 2009 fiscal year Ã¢ € ” the last of George W. BushÃ¢ € ™s presidency Ã¢ € ” federal spending rose by 17.9% from $2.98 trillion to $3.52 trillion. Check the official numbers at the Office of Management and Budget.Ã¢ € ¢ In fiscal 2010 Ã¢ € ” the first budget under Obama Ã¢ € ” spending fell 1.8% to $3.46 trillion.Ã¢ € ¢ In fiscal 2011, spending rose 4.3% to $3.60 trillion.Ã¢ € ¢ In fiscal 2012, spending is set to rise 0.7% to $3.63 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget OfficeÃ¢ € ™s estimate of the budget that was agreed to last August.Ã¢ € ¢ Finally in fiscal 2013 Ã¢ € ” the final budget of ObamaÃ¢ € ™s term Ã¢ € ” spending is scheduled to fall 1.3% to $3.58 trillion. Read the CBOÃ¢ € ™s latest budget outlook.Over ObamaÃ¢ € ™s four budget years, federal spending is on track to rise from $3.52 trillion to $3.58 trillion, an annualized increase of just 0.4%.There has been no huge increase in spending under the current president, despite what you hear.Why do people think Obama has spent like a drunken sailor? ItÃ¢ € ™s in part because of a fundamental misunderstanding of the federal budget.What people forget (or never knew) is that the first year of every presidential term starts with a budget approved by the previous administration and Congress. The president only begins to shape the budget in his second year. It takes time to develop a budget and steer it through Congress Ã¢ € ” especially in these days of congressional gridlock.The 2009 fiscal year, which Republicans count as part of ObamaÃ¢ € ™s legacy, began four months before Obama moved into the White House. The major spending decisions in the 2009 fiscal year were made by George W. Bush and the previous Congress.Like a relief pitcher who comes into the game with the bases loaded, Obama came in with a budget in place that called for spending to increase by hundreds of billions of dollars in response to the worst economic and financial calamity in generations.
DISE	Scared Silly - Any Advice?	"Hi,Thank you very much for taking the time to read my question. I am a 37 year old female. Have a Lymph node on the back of my neck about an inch below the hair line and midway between ear and spine on the right side. I know its a Lymph node because I found it early in the spring time by accident...I ended up taking Allegra and never found it again...fast foward to late August, I find the bump again!I (and I am not kidding) ran to my pcp to have her look at it. She said it is a Lymph node and she wasnt worried about it, she asked if I had any allergies or had a cold. I told her yes...then its gone again...The other day the middle back of my head felt sore, so I had my friend look at it, she says...eeewww...there just a red spot, then a few days later, hubby looks at it...says its a zip and squeezes it!! Nice...I wasnt expecting that...anyhoo...A day or two later I notice that the right side of the back of my head is sore...down low near the base of my skull...like someone rubbed it really hard...I do wear a baseball hat almost everyday to keep the sun out of my face. So, my friend looks at that area and says...its a bit flakey...I do not normally have dandruff or anything. So...my husband says to me at 1am...whats that? While rubbing my neck...and sure enough, the Lymph node is back...so I PANIC and then he says...oh, thats always been there...I have a friend who is a neurologist who told me to ""leave it alone, it'll resolve itself"" I don't want to seem paranoid...but I am...I am wondering (and I did miss two doses of the allegra before my husband found the bump again) if missing the allegra d and then having what I am assuming is a pimple of some sort could have caused the Lymph node to reappear?It is round, sorta pea sized, and isnt really hard, but isnt squishy...doesnt move much...it was this way when doc felt and saw it...also...and I had hubby check too...after taking two more doses of allegra d...it appears to be slightly smaller...and I almost always have post nasal drip when I don't take it...I am completely beside myself with worry...and am afraid I am going to die from this...Any idea?Thanks!"

TRMT	Habit of cutting myself. Help	Hey I'm Hannah and I'm 18.Now before I start explaining I already know I am going to get plenty of lectures from worried adults but yes my parents know I cut and so does my therapist and everyone else who is important. I know I shouldn't do it and it's bad for me and leaves horrible scars for a temporary situation I'm completely aware and know the consequences for doing this but what I do need is advice. I can't stop. Ive been to hospitals and recovery groups and all that jazz but we all know those things never really solve anything. I don't know why but when I feel like I'm losing control of a situation I cut. I take a razor to my thigh. Ive been doing this since I was 13 and NO it's not a cry for attention. No one knew until I was 16 when I told my parents I was going to kill myself. and from there I went to a mental hospital for a week.When I cut I feel like I'm in control of something for once and when it's over I feel a sense of..calmness. But a few minutes later when I look at the damage I did I feel like a big part of me has died. I want to stop but it's the only thing I have control over. My brother passed away 2 years ago. He was my best friend and also had depression like me. He always promised that everything would be okay and to be strong like him but when he got in that fatal car accident in 2010 we found out he over dosed on his depressions pills and passed out behind the wheel. We don't know if he just wanted a high, an accident or a suicide but my brother would never do anything to hurt anyone else and he was not suicidal in my mind. But whatever it was, was the result of him going 98 mph on a highway and hitting another car. It was never determined if he died of the OD or the crash..both would have killed him and yes the person he hit is fine, he hit the back of her truck. After that, I felt like I don't know like the hope I had of being okay was gone.I think about it alot and just try to think of the awful scars I already have and how I don't want to make more. I guess my real question is, How do you express your emotions without hurting yourself? Ive tried writing, running, reading and of course seeing a therapist. I don't want to cut anymore and I know my brother would not want me doing this.What can I do to get my emotions out in a healthy way?

He goes with his real mother three days a week and I have no idea what goes on over there. He has told me stories of what he saw his mom doing. But he is five so I do not know if I should believe him or not. My fiancÃƒ © took his toys and sat him in time out tell I got home from work. I caught him one other time doing this with his boy cousin that is the same age and I spanked him and took his toys and didn't let them play in the same room. Now my fiancÃƒ © is thinking about leaving me because she can not handle seeing him. Should I take him to see a doctor to find out what is going on with him. I am so lost with all this and it being a day before Christmas.

FAML	older sibling touching	My 19 year old daughter just told me that a year ago her 21 year old brother touched her inappropriately while she was half asleep.    At the time they talked about it and cried but now I don't know what to do.    I left them when they were 3 & 5 because of drugs and they have been raised by their father (child of an alcoholic) and mentally ill stepmom.    I'm very worried about my son who has not had a girlfriend or as far as I know any sexual experience.    I promised my daughter that I wouldn't say anything to him about this but I don't know what to do other than support her.    I'm very concerned about my son.

I got ointment for jock itch because that is what a dermatologist told me it was. This morning I noticed small pimple-like bumps in the red area on my penis.

It's hard to describe how much we love each other. We've been going out for a year and we're now just starting to have sex. I've been on birth control the entire time and we've been using condoms. We've had sex about 30 times in the past 4 months and I haven't gotten pregnant. Does that mean we're just really lucky or does this mean that might not be capable of getting pregnant naturally in the future? Kinda a stupid question huh?

SOCL	Rebooted 'Scarface' in the works	"http://scoop.today.com/_news/2011/09/22/7898154-rebooted-scarface-in-the-worksA new version of the iconic film ""Scarface"" is in the works, according to a Deadline Hollywood report. Universal Studios is behind the project, and it's still in the very early stages -- studio heads are currently meeting with writers to see who will pen the film.One important thing to note: this is not intended to be a typical remake or a sequel. Instead, the updated ""Scarface"" will include ""common elements of the first two films: an outsider, an immigrant, (who) barges his way into the criminal establishment in pursuit of a twisted version of the American dream, becoming a kingpin through a campaign of ruthlessness and violent ambition.""In the very first iteration of the film in 1932, the Tony character was an Italian who took over Chicago; when Al Pacino helmed the role, he was a Cuban in the cocaine trade in Miami. There's no word yet on what the studio has its eye on for the updated version.But here's the real question: SHOULD there even be an updated version, or should we let a good thing stand as is? For the record, lots of people were unhappy with the thought of Brian DePalma doing his version in 1983, and look how that turned out. Weigh in below, readers."

Before he started pre-school he had accidents but not nearly as many as he does now.    He tends to hold until it is too late.    I will take him to the bathroom with him pouting and telling me ""I don't have to go.""    Yet, he will end up going.    I don't understand why he will say he doesn't have to go, when he really does.    I leave him extra changes of clothes at school so I am not driving back and forth.    When I ask him what happened...he laughs and changes the subject.    I don't scold him and just tell him I need him to be my big boy and go the restroom.    He does wet the bed at night as he is a heavy sleeper and we just don't make a big deal.    We praise him HIGHLY when he doesn't have any accidents.    Please help me...I am loosing my patience.    What can I do to help my son?    I don't want this to affect self-esteem.Mom"

DISE	G.I.PA....Fibrosis/Cirrhosis - same thing?	Someone brought up a good point, and one that I've been wondering about since my diagnosis.    Are fibrosis and cirrhosis one in the same?    Some medical people imply that it is, and some imply it isn't just by the mere virtue of calling it two different things.    And, if the two are not the same, then what exactly is the difference?    I have a nice color picture (Astra Pharm) of the whole GI system, (got it from Hep doc's office) which shows what each of the healthy organs look like and what they look like as they progress towards disease.    The liver looks like this in order of severity:Normal liver->bacterial hepatitis->viral hepatitis->fatty liver->cirrhosis->post necrotic cirrhosis.    Nowhere in this diagram is there an arrow pointing to, or even a mention of, fibrosis.    Unless it's cirrhosis!    Am I on the right track?    Can you unconfuse me, if that's possible?    :)        Kathy (activist)

SOCL	Citizens United: California Becomes Sixth State To Call For Amendment Against Ruling	"California became the sixth state in the nation to take an official stand against Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, a 2010 Supreme Court ruling.One of the largest states in the nation took an official stand Thursday against the Supreme Court's 2010 decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which ruled that government restriction of corporation or union spending on political campaigns violated the First Amendment right to free speech.California joins Hawaii, Vermont, Rhode Island, Maryland and New Mexico in calling for a constitutional amendment to overturn the Supreme Court ruling.State assembly members Bob Wieckowski (D-Calif.) and Michael Allen (D-Calif.) introduced the campaign finance reform bill in January, calling for the federal government to send a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United to all the states for ratification. The measure also would serve as an official symbol of California's disagreement with the ruling.In an email to The Huffington Post, Wieckowski emphasized California's status as a trendsetter in the fight for campaign finance reform. ""A lot of national movements and trends start in California,"" wrote Wieckowski. ""We have the largest population, the most congressional representatives and the largest economy in the country. It was critical for California to take a stand.""The last constitutional amendment was ratified in 1992. When asked about the quixotic nature of his resolution, Wieckowski agreed that the fight for campaign finance reform was a challenge.""No one is underestimating how difficult it is, and justifiably so, to amend the Constitution,"" said Wieckowski. ""But being silent is worse. Failing to speak out, to organize, to hold rallies and to take action would be much worse.""""ThatÃ¢ € ™s how you bring about change in this country. By going to city hall, the state Capitol and making your voice heard and shining a light on the issue.""The moment Citizens United was first decided in 2010, Mary Zhu, a retired physician from Davis, Calif., joined other local activists to make phone calls, write letters and sign petitions against the ruling under the organizing umbrella of the non-profit Public Citizen.Together with Occupy Davis, Zhu and her friends were able to push the Davis City Council to endorse Wieckowski's bill in February. Now that she's part of a successful statewide effort, to condemn Citizens United, Zhu has no doubt that grassroots activism nationwide will eventually overturn the ruling.""California is big and powerful, and this resolution will give tremendous encouragement to other groups, Zhu said to The Huffington Post. ""It's like a stone that gets thrown in the pond; the water ripples far and wide.""When asked about bipartisan acceptance of large donations in the post-Citizens era, Zhu was realistic about how both Republican and Democratic candidates benefited. ""It's the game, and they're stuck in it. I can understand why Obama has to go along with it -- 'You don't bring a knife to a gunfight',"" Zhu said.But to Zhu, the politicians' conundrum also underscored the importance of her work as a private citizen. ""We citizens, who have nothing to gain and everything to lose -- it's our job to start screaming loud and clear. This resolution is just the beginning.""Organizations such as Public Citizen, Common Cause, CREDO Mobile, Free Speech for People and the California League of Conservation Voters all advocated for passage of the resolution in the California legislature. Public Citizen circulated a petition signed by more than 50,000 from California, and it has successfully advocated for similar resolutions in states such as Vermont and Maryland.http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/05/citizens-united-california_n_1652684.html"

PREG	Strange Ovulation Test Result	We've been using Boots Ovluation tests to conceive. Its been negative all along and then 4 days ago it had quite a dark line but not quite as dark as the test line. So I thought maybe the next day will be positive, but since then everyday it shows nothing at all or a very very light line. The test line still shows normal. Any ideas why this would be? Normally I have a 28 day cycle but last month (after being sure I was pregnant - might just have been my imagination though) my period came 4 days early. Did I maybe have an early miscarriage and now my cycle is messed up? Sorry for long post! Many Thanks!

GOAL	Hcg- side effects	I have done 2 rounds of the hcg diet using the homeopathic drops and had a total loss of 32 pounds.    I did my first round in April '11 and the second round 6 weeks later.    About 3 weeks after the second round I started to have significant hair loss.    I am still experiencing hair loss and estimate my loss to be at about 60%.    Thank goodness I had lots of hair to start with!    I would recommend to anyone interested in doing this diet that you have at least 2-3 months between rounds and only do the rounds for the minimum 23 days.    Dr. Simeon does mention this as a possible side effect but I didn't realize he meant THIS much hair loss.    He contends that the hair will grow back... I hope so!

I know someone that swears by it, to see what is going on in the whole body. Now I am a 'facts' kind of guy, not into smoke and mirrors. So I will ask, has anyone here had this done.?Since I do know partially what conditions I have, If I do this part of my believe will be how curate it is in pointing out what I already know about myself. The whole deal, including the after appt is under $300.

FAML	don't know where I fit in	"I am writing about my 5 year old step son who has definate learning and behaviour disabilities. I know it is difficult for his mother and father to accept this as nothing concrete has been done to get a diagnosis for him. They have inconsistently taken him to doctor's appointments to check his eyesight and hearing (because he can not speak well and does not listen to obvious speech directed at hime) and he has attended some speech therapy classes. His daycare was the first to notice his behaviour and reccommended he start to go to a special school they have a partnership with that deals with children with behavioural problems. He has been attending for half a day, 4 days a week for this past year. It has been suggested he may have asperger syndrome but this is not for sure but it is obvious he has a disability but it is very frustrating that his parent will not get a concrete answer for what it is so that we can proceed to help him. I try to help him with everything I can because even though he is not my blood related son, I do see him as ""my own"" and want the best for him. The bottom line is, he is a child and deserves everything this world has to offer even if it take him a little more time to get it.These are some of the behavioural specifics so you can get an idea of what I am talking about:- he constantly repeats the same things over and over- when I say he doesn't listen when he is called for it is like talking to a statue, he is completely unresponsive- he likes to be alone and not play with others- he can not speak in sentences, he can not say words clearly- he can not answer questions, he just repeats what you ask him back to you- he has an amazing memory- he can not sit still for even 30 seconds, his arms or legs are always ""squirming""- he can not make eyecontact with anyoneThose are just some of the things he does. The one I am having trouble with now is his using the toilet. He is going to be entering kindergarden this September and I am so worried for him because he is not ready to be in a class with children that are ready to be there. Who is going to help him use the toilet? Well, let me explain first. He does not stand up and urinate, that is fine but the issue is that he doesn't concentrate so some of it might get on his pants or on his leg. Once this happens he has a fit and will not wear the underwear or pants he has on. Also, if he has a bowel movement he does not know how to wipe himself. He has to call someone to help him. I have tried to show him but I am at a loss.The reason I am writing today is because we were at the park and then he had to use the restroom. He was acting strange and did not mention he had already gone in his pants. He would not leave the public restroom with the pants and underwear he had on. I had to pesuade him to come to the car so we could go home, have a bath and change clothes. His mother's solution is to alway send him to school with an extra pair of pants?? How does this solve anything??I am at a loss and I don't want to give up but this is so frustrating.Any advice would be greatly appreciated"

SOCL	FDA: Mini Eye Telescope Implant Can Bring Sight To Blind  Posted by Neil Katz Lea...	"WASHINGTON (CBS/AP) It may sound like a James Bond gadget, but the FDA has just approved a miniature telescope - smaller than a pea - that can help with a leading cause of blindness for seniors when implanted inside the eye.How does it work?Surgeons put the Implantable Miniature Telescope in one eye, allowing the person to improve central vision for tasks like reading, watching TV and recognizing faces. Doctors leave the other eye alone to provide peripheral vision.http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504763_162-20009834-10391704.html?tag=latestThe trick here is that the brain must fuse the two different views into a single image. The Food and Drug Administration says patients will need post-surgery rehabilitation to make that happen.The invention doesn't work for everyone.According to Dr. Malvina Eydelman, the FDA's ophthalmic devices chief, the device is specifically geared for a subset of the nearly 2 million Americans with advanced macular degeneration - those 75 and older, with a certain degree of vision loss, who also need a cataract removed.In a 219-patient study, the FDA said 90 percent of telescope recipients had their vision improve by at least two lines on an eye chart, and three-quarters went from severe to moderate vision impairment.It's not a miracle cure cautioned ophthalmic surgeon Dr. Kathryn Colby of Harvard and the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston""We're not giving people back 20-year-old eyes,"" she said.But by magnifying images onto more of the retina than its diseased center, someone who before couldn't see an entire face might now miss only the nose, said Colby, who helped lead manufacturer VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies' study of the implant.And it's not risk free.Concern about damage to the inside lining of the cornea, the eye's clear front covering that helps focus light, held up FDA approval for several years. In that study, 10 eyes had serious corneal swelling, five that required corneal transplants. FDA's Eydelman said the company proposed candidate restrictions to minimize that risk, and will study how an additional 770 recipients fare after sales begin.In fact, the FDA took the highly unusual step of requiring that patients and their surgeons sign a detailed ""acceptance of risk agreement"" before surgery, acknowledging potential side effects -- including corneal damage and worsened vision -- and the need for lots of testing to determine who's a candidate.VisionCare, of Saratoga, Calif., is seeking Medicare coverage for the surgery and rehab costs, a package that it calls CentraSight. The company wouldn't estimate total costs but said the device itself costs $15,000."

DEMO	Pelvic Pain Associated w My Period	"I am a 37 year old female who has a long history with severe pelvic pain associated with my period.    I have had a lot of doctors check out my situation and all tests come back as ""normal"".    At one point about 7 years ago it was suggested I have a hysterectomy as it seems no answers can be found.    Recently I have made several trips to the ER in a final attempt to figure out why I have so much pain.    Again, all lab work and ultrasounds have come back as normal.    I find this hard to believe as for one, my cervix has been described as severely tilted up and to the right (to the point some doctors have a very difficult time finding it during exams) and 2, the pain is so severe I can be down for up to 2 weeks at a time.    Something has to be causing this.    If I had someone tell me what was actually wrong and that a hysterectomy was my only option, I would do it in a flash.    But I don't want to go through with such a radical surgery if there might be other options.    The only diagnosis I can seem to get is menorrahgia, and all hormone therapies have only helped my heavy flow issues, not the pain.    I have no children and have only been pregnant once, which was ectopic and resulted in the removal of one tube when I was 19.    A recent pelvic/transvaginal ultrasound stated there were no significant cystic or solid masses, but did state, ""a few tiny follicular cysts"" were noted bilaterally.    If anyone has any suggestions I would be grateful to hear them.    Living on Percocet at least one week out of every month is not how I want to continue my life."

He has shown no symptoms of malaria whatsoever, but both the tests that Red Cross administered came back as positive.He does not know what to do, as treatment may be so expensive in the US. He will be making another trip to Asia in mid-January, and wonders if it is ok to wait until then to go to a doctor.What would you suggest?Thanks so much,Shruthi

TRMT	deep laceration to forearm	On December 5th, 2006, I sustained a nasty laceration to my forearm after falling on a glass which subsequently took a gouch out my arm which left me with a hanging skin flap. On attending the A&E dept, they inserted 7 stitches, however I then got an infection so the stitches had to come out, I attended the hospital on a daily basis to get dressings changed as laceration was very deep. Thereafter attented my local practise nurse for a further 4 weeks until wound had healed on the outside. I realise I am going to be left with a nasty scar, but my concerns are that the 'flap' of skin is still raised and not level with my arm, what I was wondering was will this ever reduce and eventually be level again.I would rather not be looking at cosmetic surgery !!Look forward to hearing your advice.

SOCL	Taliban stone couple to death for adultery	"They were discovered by Taliban operatives on Sunday and stoned to death in front a crowd of about 150 men, Aqyar said. He said the woman was brought out and stoned first, then the man a half an hour later.'It is against all human rights'Aqyar decried the punishment, which he said was ordered by two local Taliban commanders.""It is against all human rights and international conventions,"" said spokesman Mabubullah Sayedi. ""There was no court. It was cruel.""Amnesty International said it was the first confirmed stoning in Afghanistan since the fall of Taliban rule in the 2001 U.S.-led invasion.It called the stoning a ""heinous crime"" that showed the Taliban and other insurgent groups ""are growing increasingly brutal in their abuses against Afghans.""""Amnesty International has warned that the Afghan government should not sacrifice human rights, particularly the rights of women and minorities, in the name of reconciliation with the Taliban and other insurgent groups,"" the London-based rights group said.A Taliban spokesman could not immediately be reached for comment.The ancient practice of death by stoning has been abandoned in all but a handful of countries. It is still a legal punishment in some countries, like Iran, which justify it under Shariah, or Islamic law, although human rights activists say the Quran never specifically prescribed stoning for adultery.Last month, Iran's religious authorities called off the planned stoning of a woman convicted of cheating on her husband. Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani's sentence Ã¢ € ” which would have been Iran's first stoning since 2008 Ã¢ € ” was lifted following a campaign by politicians, rights groups, diplomats and celebrities around the world.Copyright 2010 The Associated Press.

GOAL	Spinning Pain	Ok not sure if this is in the right place but here goes.Last week I went to my first spinning class. The next day I had sore muscles (as I had thought I would, it being my first time). I went to my second class 2 days after my first - still with sore muscles but thinking it would help. Well, it didn't. The second class was yesterday and for the rest of the day, and also today, I have not been able to walk well, bend my knees, lift my leg (mainly my right leg). The muscles in the front of my thigh are in agony. I have been resting, taking ibuprofen and applying Bengay to my thighs and I am just about able to move around. Is there anything else I can do to help relieve the pain? Should I make a doctor's appointment or am I doing all I can? When will I start to feel some relief??I really did enjoy the classes and would like to continue but this pain is worse than any exercise related muscle pain I've had before. I don't want to go back until after my muscles have healed, but I'm worried that the same thing will happen if I go back when I'm feeling better.
DISE	Help- Really Scared due to rising elevated white count	Ok- so I went to my GP on 1/28 with two issues after returning from a business trip. Both turned out to be trouble.1) I had fallen down on ice- and my thumb was injured2) I had a badly swollen lymph node in my neck.He prescribed Augmentin and made an appointment for me with a hand specialist. I started    taking Augmentin on 1/29. Went to the hand specialist on 2/3/09. THe hand specialist confirmed I had torn my ligament and needed surgery asap since the injury can only be repaired if it is done expediantly. As customary I guess, a CBC is performed before surgery and was done on 2/4/09. The white count showed an elevated count of 13,000. Surgeon wont perform elective surgery with an elevated white count. So I take a follow-up, and the count is 17,000 the next day on 2/5. Now I am in limbo with my thumb and concerned about my health. My GP makes an appointment with a Hematologist the next day (2/6) and it shows 18,000. He draws about 6 viles of blood for what seems like a complete blood analysis that in large part wont have results returned until this Thursday. So I go online, and I read about white counts and fears of Leukemia or STDS emerge in my mind. I have no outtward signs of infection including the lymph node going down to normal and the hospital did some additional blood tests that showed no confirmed infections in my system. What's more, a chest xray ordered by my GP was negative (I am a smoker) Today I do feel kinda weak and like something is wrong.    So I am left worried I have something really serious and I cant fix my thumb until I confirm no infection or my white count declines. I am so scared right now!!! HELP!!!
TRMT	2 dents on side of head from sleeping with glasses?	Im not really looking for cosmet surgery, but here's my problem;Im 'm 16 now in 11th grade. Ever since 3rd grade when I had glasses I slept with them sometimes. Now I have a dent on each side of my face towards the front of my ear where the arms of the glasses were just lodged into my head when I slept on the side of my face. I just noticed these dents recently and it really blow me self esteem away. I stoped wearing my glasses about a month ago and im just wondering, has anyone else had this problem and did it fix itself or did you just live with it?It gives the illusion that I have a big head like one of those smart kids from a cartoon and my self esteem is really low right now.. Will this fix itself with time or would I need cosmetic surgery...?

GOAL	Right Eye Detachment Surgery	Hello,I went to my doctor this past Tuesday morning and he told me I needed surgery for my right eye the same day.    I had a retina detachment.    He said that I caught it in time before it hit the center of my eye.    I was in shock to say the least.    My parents just left for their vacation that morning for a 2-week cruise.    They wanted to cancel their trip and come home to me, but I told them no.    Thank God, my friend Terry was there to go with me to get the surgery.    They told me that they put in a belt into my eye and gave me the gas bubble.    It's only been two days since my surgery and trying to look through my eye is quite difficult.    The gas bubble is effecting my balance and actually making me quite nauseous.    Is this normal?    I'm only 41 years old and they said I should recover quite quickly.    I am doing my drops and pain medications as prescribed, but I am keeping the patch on my eye all the time because I am actually afraid to take it off except to put in my drops and change the patch.    When should I remove the patch?    I thank you for any support and answers to my questions.

SOCL	mammogram tests	I am a 50 year old women, I had my annual mammogram test six months ago. They called me back in for a second one, and a ultrasound. They had just switched to digital. I have always had lumpy breasts and dense ones.I have no history of breast cancer in my family. I don't smoke or drink and have never used birth control pills or hormones. They wanted me to return in 6 months for another mammogram for a follow up. Is this normal practice or should I be worried about something. The xray tech. told me not to worry, that they do this alot with women with dense breasts because there harder to read.Theresa

DISE	Oral STDs	I just recieved unprotected oral from my girlfriend and i was wondering what are the chances of contracting or giving an STD. We are both complete virgins and this is our first time ever doing anything sexually except masturbation and neither of us has ever had cold sores and we don't believe that either of us has HIV or gonorrhea. We realized that it is pretty uncommon to contract STDs from oral sex and we both believe that we weren't born with any STDs of our own so we feel that there is nothing to worry about but i was just wondering what the chances are of us getting STDs from this. I precummed a fair amount in her mouth and i ejaculated too but not much was in her mouth. We don't believe anything has happened but i would just like some clarification as to what the chances of us getting anything from it are. Thanks

FAML	School-age children sleeping with parent	I am a somewhat recent step mom of two daughters (7 and 9) and a son (10).    The children live with their father and I and visit their mother every other weekend.    Up until now, the visits have been for 6-8 hours during the day.    Their mother has a history of mental instability, but has been stable for the past 6 months or so.    She wants to keep the children overnight, but lives in a small apartment and stated that the girls would sleep in the same (double) bed as she does and son would sleep on an air bed in the same room.    My instincts tell me that this is a BAD idea, but I don't want to be unreasonable if there is nothing for me to fear.    Can you tell me what negative impact this might have on the children (the girls especially)?

FAML	Inappropriate touching	"My 4 yr old nephew told his nana that when him and my daughter were watchin a tv show together that my 7 yr old daughter pulled up her shirt and told my nephew to kiss her boobs, her belly and then her butt. When I asked her about this she said it didn't happen. I asked if either of them had touched each other's private parts or if any ""kissing"" had happened. She told me no she didn't do it and that she didn't want to ever talk about it. I am concerned with this as I feel she is not telling me what happened. I assured her she nor my nephew would get in trouble over it and she again said she did not want to talk about it. I don't want to be pressing so I stopped, but where should i go now with it? Should I take her to a professional? Or just check out some local books and videos from the library and make sure she is well educated in this department of inappropriate touching and kissing?"

GOAL	Unwanted Weight Gain	Hello, I have been gaining weight at a rate of 2.5 pounds every month since September 2006.    I have gone from 145 (after having my daughter and working to lose weight) to 190 present day.    The obscene weight gain started when I began school again (full time) along with working (full time) and single motherhood.    I drink    ~80 oz. of water daily, I count calories, I work out (weights and aerobic/cardio) for an hour a day, I had a trainer, I have tried low carb, low fat and supplements.    Nothing has worked to stop or reverse the gain.    I have seen my generl practioner and had blood work done and everything came back normal.    I noticed stretch marks on my biceps two days ago.    I can not keep gaining like this.    Please help!

GOAL	Worried about going blind !!!!!!	5 years ago i had cavenous sinus thrombosis and got diabetes insipidus as a result. i am on warfarin for life and desmopressin. I was in hospital for 8 weeks and had double vision for about the same length of time. My head still has clots but is 90% clear. When i first came out and my vision went back to normal for a time my prescription improved. Over the last 2/3 years it has got worse and each time i go to the opticians they seem concerned. They do field tests which i struggle with, but i think this is more that the test is so close, and when i look at the screen instead of being a plain backgroud appears sort of wavy/swirly. Last time specsavers sent me to the doctors, the doctors were unconcerned by the change. I've just been again and once again they are referring me to the doctors. I have not seen the doctor yet. Over the last 2/3 years my prescription has changed by about +2/3 in both eyes and the other measurements have increased as well. Why do my eyes keep changing ????? am i going blind ???? what should i do/say when i see the doctor ???? i also have had trouble over the last few years where i see blue sparks/flickers, this happened on time when i was rubbing my eye and happened ever since. Also when im in bed and i have my left eye shut and i move it or touch it i get like white flash at the top or bottom of my eye. I am so worried !!!!!!

FAML	Community Swimming Pools	"I am a manager of my community pool in my Homes Association.    Normally these pools do not have a life guard on duty but have rules posted saying ""No children under 12 allowed without an adult swimmer, 18 or older).    Other rules for safey are posted too: No food, alchohol, glass, animals in pool area.    No running etc.    You've all seen them if you have been in these pools.This is my first year as the manager and only day 4. We have 214 units in our HOA with about 25% of these now being rentals of absentee landlords.    Most of these rentals turn over every year or two bring new families.Just in the past 4 days I have seen very few adults at the pool with their children who are under 12.    Trying to enforce this rule is almost impossible.Please parents:    Do not let you kids go to any pool without proper supervision. Do not depend on other people to watch your kids.    We have tried issuing keys, but these kids are smart--they just open the gates from the inside.    We did try a pool watcher but they don't show up.    Don't let your kids be the ones responsible for shutting down    great summertime entertainment for the whole area.    Remind your kids that alcohol & swimming do not go good together.Thanks for reading this."

Her ELISA was negative (but so was every other test they've run on her!) and drs aren't interested in following up with a Western Blot.    I'm trying to decide whether or not to push.First, I should say that she never had a tick bit that we know of, although she was definately in some tick-y areas first week of May.    Also, she spent two weeks in rural China at end of March, so no telling what she might have gotten into there.Symptoms:    At end of May, she woke up with a wobbly ankle... it just rolls outward when she walks.    She can stand on toes, but not on heel.    During testing, drs discovered some numb areas on leg and opposite arm.    Her leg went completely numb for about a week this summer, then went back to just wobbly after she fell and her back seemed to pop.    (No, she has no back problems,according to numeous MRIs and CT scans).    She has extreme fatigue and back pain.    No headaches, fever or other ""viral"" type symptoms.I've discovered I can pull anything from any description on internet and make it fit her... so I'm asking those of you who've really been there.     Does this sound at all like lyme--or another tick disease--to you?Thanks!dazedmom"

FAML	Help!! Im not sure what to do!! My 5 Year old told me his new friend was touching...	At school today, My 5 year old and his new friend where in the bathroom, unsupervised. My son says, his friend and him where showing eachother their penis'. My son also stated that his friend wanted to kiss my sons butt cheeks. Thats not all, this friend also tried to touch his anus. My son knows better. I think there might be some curiosity here. But Im unsure how this will affect my son. Is this normal? My son has never, ever made up a story like this before. Im not sure if he is telling the truth or not. a few minutes after he told this to me, he claimed he was tricking me. Here is a little bit of back story on the situation. My 5 year old is in his 2nd week of kindergarten. I know he is eager to make friends. He is an only child. Today, he was given permission to go to the bathroom after lunch. He never returned to class. He was MIA, for over 30 min in the bathroom. None of his teachers noticed he never came back to class. It wasnt untill I was there to pick him, that they realized he wasnt in the class. Neither was his new friend. After about 15 min of searching, his friend came out of the bathroom. Then a few minutes later, my son came out. My son claims they were both on the toilet, in separate stalls. But then he shares all of these other details. So I really have no idea what went on in that bathroom. I have no info on this boy, I know nothing of him. I dont want to make my son feel guilty. But i need to get to the bottom of what happened in the bathroom. If this boy has seen things, or been exposed to things my son hasnt. Im not sure how this incident will affect him. i dont want this to be come an ongoing issue. Please help with any advice possible. I can reply with more info if needed.

TRMT	LGSIL 12 years post hysterectomy	I had a LAVH 12 years ago, one ovary left in place for hormone reasons.    I am 41 years old and have not gone through menopause yet.    The hysterectomy was done for endometriosis.    I have always had normal Pap smears, and continued to have them done yearly after the hysterectomy.    I had my annual done 2 weeks ago and received a call Monday that it came back showing LGSIL and HPV high risk positive.    She stated I should come in for a colposcopy to look at my cervix, so I had to remind her that I don't have a cervix.    My question is what are the consequences to these test results if I don't have a cervix?    Are there the same implications to the vagina?    I am not sure if I should be worried or not, what kind of treatment can be done, and just exactly what this means.    Any information or direction to find info would be appreciated.

FAML	Concern for 3 1/2 year old boy--learning skills	My 3 1/2 year old son wasa llate talker and is still receiving speech services.    He is doing well talking but now I am concerned with him mastering some basic skills.    I work with him and he still doesn't know his colors or shapes.    He knows the names but gets them all mixed up.    Same issue with letters.    Should I be worried (because I am)?    There doesn't seem to be anything I can do to see if there is a learning issue at this age.    Any advice?
GOAL	20/30	My son's sight was just tested and he has 20/30 vision.    It's not perfect but it's not bad either.    The optometrist said he can probably see fine but if he sits far from the board at school, he may have difficulty reading it.    My son plays little league and will be playing basketball in the fall.    I wanted to get some advise on whether I should get him prescription glasses.    Should I wait until he is complaining that he is having difficulty seeing things or get a mild prescription for him now.    I don't think it affects his sports but who knows if he'll do better if he has clearer vision.    Please advise.    Thanks!
PREG	Bloodclotting dissorders while preg.	i was told i have two MTHFRmutations, the bloodclotting dissorders.(two copys, as my dr said) so i am guessing one copy from my mother and one from my father.    so now when i get preg. i have to take 81mg. of baby asprin a day, projestrone(sp?), and my vitimins. and was told that i could only take two types of birthcontroll, the minipill and the merina(sp?), the bc that goes in your cirvex i believe. but my husband and i just decided to use condoms.i have 2 sisters (younger than me) one 16, one 10. now my middle sister is having sex, and is on the ring, she knows she isnt ready and she says they use a condom too.(i know that sounds young but i was 15 and married the man that was my first and she is still with the boy she gave herself to and they have been together for almost a year, and they are using protection, back to the subject((i get side tracked very easily)))*** BUT my question is since i have the bloodclotting dissorder should she get tested too for the same bloodclotting dissorders??? since she is taking a birthcontroll. i am just worried about if she has it too, then the type of birthcontroll she is on can up her chances of a bloodclott.

I have tried various medications, supplements, hormones, foods and physical changes to my bedroom.I have what the doctor called Ã¢ € œsituational insomniaÃ¢ € . When things are on my mind, when I have an important day ahead of me, when life is generally not going my way I canÃ¢ € ™t sleep. I am tired of being tired. I am tired of being told that there is nothing wrong with me.

I am looking forward    to what I hope will be a positive, interesting and helpful experience.

A security camera just outside the store's entrance captured the scene as Lansing approached the door only to have a young man suddenly emerge from behind a column and grab her purse.Click the link to Watch...
GOAL	followup re meds causing dry eyes	For those of you who asked. I visited my PCP yesterday, and we discussed wether Cymbalta could be causing all my dry eye problems. He said yes. I started it 2 months before all of my eye problems started. I now have severe dry eys. I have been using at various times Optivar, Lotimax, Sooth XP, and now Restasis. The PCP gave me a scrip to start titering down the Cymbalta. Can't stop it cold turkey without major withdrawal sx's.    There were many of you who asked me to post what I found out, so there it is.

TRMT	Regretting Hysterectomy	"I had a hysterectomy Dec.2010 due to fibroids and heavy bleeding.    I am 48 years old and sadly, didn't research things as much as I should have.    Due to the economy, my husband had to take a job out of state and I work full-time and also raise my developmentally disabled adult daughter.    I was afraid of having another bad bleeding ""incident"" and was extremely anemic.    I thought a partial hysterectomy was just my uterus, leaving the ovaries intact and just found out that my doctor took my cervix also.    She never once told me that she was going to do that.    She in fact, pushed to take the ovaries, but I told her no.    Now I'm afraid I will never enjoy sex again because of my dryness and I feel cheated out of a decision that I thought I made with all the knowledge and research that I did do.    I don't know how to handle this.    Are there any women who feel the way I feel?    I feel castrated."

DISE	ulnar nerve problems after extensive elbow surgery	Approximately 2 years ago I had a biking accident and did sever damage to my elbow.    I snapped the head of the radius completely off and dislocated the humerus.    In the process I also managed to tare the entire lateral ligament complex of the elbow.    My surgeon managed to relocate the humerus and reattach the head of the radius with a plate and some screws.    He also managed to reattach the torn ligaments.    After many months of physical therapy I now have almost all of my range of motion back.    Since the pain of the surgery has gone away I started to notice that I have been having ulnar nerve problems.    Every time I rest my arm on something, like an arm rest, my pinkie finger and ring finger fall asleep really quickly.    I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else out there. Or if someone could point me in the right direction with possible problems or treatment.     Thanks in advance.

We have a cat sitter coming in and my house is just embarrasing...more so than usual because I have NO energy to even straighten up.    I never had energy for cleaning but it's even worse now.Anyway...my question is about itching and dysautonomia.    I have allergies that got diagnosed...wow, almost 10 years ago when I was getting hives all over my body.    I came up positive for mold, dust, wheat, eggs grasses, and cats.    The food allergies have to be mild because besides not being able to get flu shots (they are ""grown"" in eggs and everytime I've gotten one, I had a reaction), I can eat wheat and eggs.    I take Allegra and Clarinex daily and they control the other ones...including CAT!    We have three :)    Anyway...I have been uncontrollably itching around my neck and upper back as well as lower arms over the past month or so.    It's entirely possible it's the change of season but it's never been this bad.    I've worn the same gold necklace for 28 years and I can't believe all of a sudden I could be allergic to gold.    I took it off to see if it helped and so far nothing.    I hate having it off...it has my cross on it and I just hate not having it on!So my question is this...I have read snippets here and there about antihistimines being helpful for us.    What's the reason for that?    Do you think the dysautonomia has anything to do with the itching?    Thanks in advance :)Going for a holter monitor tomorrow...don't think it's gonna show anything.    I don't believe I have any arrhythmias or an irregular heartbeat with the NCS but we'll see!Stephanie"

SOCL	Romney defends &#x27;poor people&#x27; remark	"http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/01/10290590-romney-defends-poor-people-remarkOn his campaign's flight to Minnesota this morning, Mitt Romney vigorously defended his economic message and engaged in a bit of damage control when asked by a reporter to explain his comment on CNN that he is ""not concerned about the very poor.""""No no no no. No no. You've got to take the whole sentence, all right, as opposed to saying, and then change it just a little bit, because then it sounds very different. I've said throughout the campaign my focus, my concern, my energy is gonna be devoted to helping middle income people, all right? We have a safety net for the poor in, and if there are holes in it, I will work to repair that. And if there are people that are falling through the cracks I want to fix that,"" Romney said. ""Wealthy people are doing fine. But my focus in the campaign is on middle income people. Of course I'm concerned about all Americans -- poor, wealthy, middle class, but the focus of my effort will be on middle income families who I think have been most hurt by the Obama economy.""advertisementOn CNN this morning, Romney gave a shorter version of that response, upon which both Republican and Democrats quickly seized, looking to paint the Republican frontrunner as uncaring and out of touch. (Rick Tyler, a spokesman for a pro-Gingrich super PAC tweeted about the quote.)Ã¢ € œIÃ¢ € ™m not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair, IÃ¢ € ™ll fix it,"" Romney told CNN's Soledad O'Brien. ""IÃ¢ € ™m not concerned about the very rich, theyÃ¢ € ™re doing just fine. IÃ¢ € ™m concerned about the very heart of the America, the 90 percent, 95 percent of Americans who right now are struggling.Ã¢ € The line, problematic in soundbite form, is by no means new to Romney's stump speech or interview talking points. Romney frequently discusses the need to help the middle class rebound from the effects of the recession as a primary motivating factor for his campaign.Romney's also spoken in the past about his concern for the impoverished.""I'm concerned about the poor in this country. We have to make sure the safety net is strong and able to help those who can't help themselves,"" Romney said in South Carolina. ""I'm not terribly worried about the very wealthiest in our society, they're doing just fine. I'm concerned about the vast middle class of our nation, the 90 percent of Americans, the 95 percent of Americans who are having tough times.""On the plane this morning, Romney also conceded that he did see holes in the safety net that would need fixing.""Oh I'm sure there are. I'm sure there are places where people fall between the cracks. And finding those places is one of the things that is the responsibility of government. We do have a very ample safety net in America, with Medicaid, housing vouchers, food stamps, earned income tax credit. We have a number of ways of helping the poor,"" Romney said. ""And yet my focus and the area that I think is the greatest challenge that the country faces right now is not, is not to focus our effort on how we help the poor as much as to focus our effort on how to help the middle class in America, and get more people in the middle class and get people out of being poor and becoming middle income."""

After I shaved and we would have intercourse I get what I believe is genital folliculitis but am not sure. It appears to be ingrown hairs, itches/hurts a little, and only happens when I have sex.

They go away when I do not have intercourse and only come back after a few times of sexual relations. Please let me know what they are and how to treat them.

DISE	years of changing migraines	"I had my first migraine at 26 (now 36 years old) when I was active Army and working outside.    I was seeing ""stars"" following sudden, severe, disabling sharp pain in my head that lasted 2 hours. I thought I was going to die and went to the ER where at that time diagnosed me as being dehydrated and having sleep depravation.    I had about 2 migraines per year similar to this one for the next few years.Later I started to get worse migraines.    I was seeing black spots, ""shooting stars"", and streaks of ""lightening"" and complete blurriness along with confusion, feeling numbness in my arms and neck and head, tingling sensations in my cheeks and jaw, bitter taste in my mouth, excessive salilva(?), cold sweats, and nausea, following severe pain in my head for about 1-2 hours. I had this about every 30-60 days.    It seemed like I always had some kind of vision problem with seeing ""stars"" when around sunlight and bright lights during this time.Currently, I feel like I am on the verge of getting a migraine everyday. Meaning that I feel confusion, dizzy(unbalanced), eye sensitivity, and nausea with pressure in my head and neck, with a bitter taste in my mouth and the numbness - without always having the severe pain follow.    Sometimes the pain does follow, especially if I am not able to lay down and rest.    It seems to help to completely rest and not skipping any meals and have snacks with lots or protein.My vision is normal according to the DMV and I don't wear glasses or contacts.Is this simply migraines?    What else could this be?    I had a lump directly under my chin come and go in the last few years could this be related?"
PREG	Pregnancy/Ovulation concern	I tried to post this question under the pregnancy forum, but received an error message saying it was full. So, I am posting it here.I am a 25 year old college student who has only been sexually active for about 8 months (have been a virgin before that). I have been taking oral contraceptives due to the fact that I have endometriosis, and have had it for several years. Now that I'm sexually active, the pills are a big plus. My boyfriend and I have been using condoms as well as the pill since day one. We are both very serious students and know that a child right now would not be the best for us. We do plan on marrying after school.Anyway, last night we had a condom breakage situation and we are both a bit frantic now. With my cycles I have been instructed by my doctor to take the pills for 3 months straight without pausing for a cycle (skipping the pink sugar pills). According to my pills, I should be on about the 4 or 5th day of my period, but am taking taking the white pills and skipping it. Not sure if I am ovulating right now due to the strange cycle schedule my doctor has me on.I also took the first of the two morning after pills last night and will take the next in a couple of hours. Does any one know what the liklihood of me being pregnant is? Should I take a preg test in a week or so? I'm so new to this, I feel really lost. Please help.

I'm only 40(almost) and like a clean house, nice yard, and try to enjoy my garden, but its impossible to keep up when one day in the garden lays me on the couch for 2 days. Or one day of thoroughly cleaning my house does the same. What options do I have available with the cage already in there? I've got to do something besides pain meds and injections.They are not helping and I don't want to be on anything stronger than hydro 10 or I'm still laying around from no energy. Any suggestions?

DEMO	how I cured sore penis	I'm 67 years old and developed little red tears (i.e. small lesions) near the tip of the penis through frequent sex with a sex toy using what I now realize was insufficient lubrication.The cure was as follows: first, zinc ointment + Lubriderm applied on a daily basis;    second, use of a really good lubricant called ID Glide (quite inexpensive on Amazon).    I did not refrain from sex, just kept using the ointment and the lubriderm until the red tears healed.I have sex with one of my sex toys at least once a day these days, and no soreness... am still using the lubriderm after each orgasm, and using sufficient lubricant to avoid serious friction.This discussion is related toAdditions to my last post.

GOAL	Just to say thankyou	"Dear Doctor Hagan,My pink eye is gone, my eye isn't dry anymore and I'm quite glad to be able to use mycontacts again, at least for the time being.    It's quite enough having severe myopia and these awful retinas my doctorskeep comparing to old chinese vases full of cracks and hoping the worst will never happen!By the way, would a section called ""Success Stories"" or something like that be doable?You know just somewhere where all good experiences were put together. Just a thought.Anyway, I just wanted to reiterate my deep appreciation for the Eye Doctors on Medhelp and you in particular.You have been of great help and comfort and for example your advice two years ago helped me to decideagainst IOLS until I really need them because of my high myopia.Although I do try to do a lotof research wherever I can, you have given me and of course uncountless people all over the worldinvaluable information.Again thank you immensely and keep up the excellent work!Very best wishes,Sophia"
FAML	4 year old boy has begun hitting	My 4 year old son named Will has begun having a hard time keeping his hands to himself and during disagreements actually gets physical with other children (boys). Since he moved into pre-k he has been a very well behaved, participative child. This is a new development in the last 2 weeks.    Is this a normal occurance at his age?    How should we respond as parents. We have spoken to him a number of times,    stating the rules at school, and used time out. We have also taken away privilages (1 being Wii, which we allow him to play 1/2 hr. a day). We wrestle sometimes at home and play sports. thanksPat and Terry
FAML	my 3.5 year old is biting and pushing in pre-school.	My son was adopted internationally at 14 months. At 15 months we had him evaluated (he only knew Russian)and he met the requirements for early intervention for speech and after 6 months he joined a play group for 2 hrs. once a week. After 18 months of services with early intervention my son tested out of everything--they did the an extensive testing--speach--OT-PT -psyc,just about 4 months ago my husband and I signed my son up for pre-school so he would have interaction with other children his age. 2 weeks after being in the pre-school he was bitten by another child--well, now we are having issues with my son biting. He has bitten 3x since he first started with the program9since he recieved his first bite) and is now suspended for a day with the program. A month ago my son met with the sensory person(an outside consult recomended from the school) the outcome was that my son had some transition issues and it was recommended that the school have pictures for him to what he is going to be doing next--something my husband and I did with him at an early age do to the language gap so he could understand or communicate with us. I am not sure if the school has followed up on this but--the consult also mentioned that my son needs sensory stimulation--recogmendations were made for that. My son attempted to bite me once and was immediately put into timeout and his favorate toy was taken away--he has never attempted to bite--he attempted to hit once and I followed that same proceedure and he has never attempted it again. At home he has the normal 3 yr. old issues and they are immediately addressed. I can take my son anywhere and my friends are always commenting how good my son is. Now I hear a completely different thing from school and I don't see any of the behaviors that the school is mentioning. His teacher are great at giving feedback which I like and I don't want my son to be thrown out of this school. Tomorrow my son and I will be doing some role playing and working on how he can express his frustration --I am not sure how that will go but, since he has been suspended it will not be a fun filled day of play for him--I will remind him that he could be playing with toys at school--but. with not seeing this behavior I don't want to put all the blame on him because I don't know if all of the events leading up to the bite are all his fault--the bite definitely is--but at 3.5 years of age he is still working on developing how to express his frustration. Any advice or suggestions will be very appreciated.Thank you for your time!Trigal

FAML	Why does my 5 yr.old stepson want to turnover my 5 mths old elevated seat?	"Why does stepson want to turnover my 5 mths old elevated seat?    My husband and I asked why he would do that? His reply was, and I quoate ""I Dont Like her I want to Hurt Her!""    How do you take something like that?    We were totally floored and really didnt know how to react to it exccept to tell him if you ever do something like that again    you will get whipped, and then I asked him how do you not like your baby sister?    She is a part of you, and Daddy.    He looks at me with this smirk of a smile, and    eyes that are soulless and says ""IM JUST AMAZING"".    Wow was that a smack in the face or what?    He also is about to kicked off his school bus for hurting other kids on the bus and he also hurts kids at school.    I Have a daycare in my home and he is always hurting the kids that cannot or wont defend themselves, plus the kids that will defend themselves. Pretty much all of them!    He knows what he is doing cause he will ask them to not tell on him(which I have heard him say)and then try to lie to me with a lie that is so far out on left-field that Im like WHAT?    He has this crazy and I mean CRAZY obsession with the alphabet, I mean it is so bad that his father saw a movie title that read The Alphabet Killer and said that will be Austin someday(this was said before    had tried to hurt our daughter) . Thats not funny now and I want to know if something might be wrong with him, I am really scared for my baby girl.    He is a very very very bright little boy.    Almost to the point that sometimes I feel like he sits back and laughs about how stupid we are.    It is like he is on a mission with everything he doing, saying, seeing, feeling, and thinking that it truly scares me.    His Egg Donor(is what we like to call her) has not been in the picture since he was 2 1/2 and alot of bad things happened to my stepson while he was with Egg D when my husband and her was in thier on again off again marriage.    I have a 13 Yr old also from a previous marriage and she is lacking my attention due to the fact we have to keep the baby in our arms 24/7.

DEMO	non menstrual bleeding	I had a salipingo oopharectomy last year and also had 2 large cysts removed (fluid filled). I know I have a lot of uterine fibroids and periods have been less painful and less heavy since the op.However,occasionally (3/4 per year) I now experience extremely heavy bleeds not related to periods,containing very large clots and at times can be very difficult to manage/leave the houseI have been given transanamic acid to assist with these bleeds but as I have no warning as to when they will ocour - life is difficult.

TRMT	SGPT high	My husband had undergone blood works three months back and his total cholesterol was 228, triglycerides 254 and LDL 128. The sgpt level was 47. This was done with his normal routine i.e where he was having 2-3 pegs a week. Since triglycerides was high we controlled the diet for 3 months and dint touch alcohol but there was no exercise and when we rechecked after 3 months his total cholesterol is 290, triglyceride 250 and LDL 216. The sgpt value is 110. But all other LFT normal. We did an ultrasound and it sound mild hepatomegaly with diffuse fatty infilteration and rest all organs normal. Should i be worried with these values?? The doctor told to diet and exercise and come back after 1 month. Still im just worried y the sgpt increased from 47 to 110 inspite of alcohol abstinence. Also the LDL cholesterol has increased. Please advise..
FAML	Hard time adapting to Pre-K	I have a 4 year-old son who has just started pre-k this year and he is having a hard time coping with his new environment. Up until now, he has never been in any type of structured environment. From the time he was born, he was babsitted by grandmammas on both sides of the family where there was no structure. I must admitt because of this, he is spoiled and very stubborn. Everyday he goes to school and I get a bad report from his pre-k teacher that he is hitting, talking back to her, will not do what he is asked to do, and so on. He has poor cognative skills that needs some work and we are looking into getting him so therapy for that. But my question is, is he showing any signs of AD or some sort of mental behavior? He has a nine-year old brother who has ADHD and has been taking meds since he was six years old.

PREG	Changing hCG Numbers	Hello Friends,I had three embryos transfered on March 1st and had a positive beta on March 12th.    The amount of hCG detected was 334. On March 14th, the hCG level had risen to 584.    Because it didn't double, my clinic wants me to take a third beta on Monday, March 17th.     My hCG levels increased 75% in exactly 48 hours.

FAML	Four year old daughter suddenly sobbing	"My four year old daughter has very recently (within the past few days) begun sobbing hysterically about how she hates our current house because it contains sharp knives and sharp scissors.    She asks me incessantly (i.e., every five minutes or so) when we can move out of the house and go to live at the lake.    She insists we will need to take everything from the current house except the bathtubs and toilets, because we will use the lake both as a toilet and a bathtub.She has begun to refuse to use the bathroom, going so far as wetting herself when she could no longer hold it in and pooping in her pants.    She claims that she is scared because the toilet might over flow if she uses too much toilet paper and has compromised by putting the paper in the trash can and refusing to flush.    She will additionally concede to using her old baby potty.She recently revised her lake/house issue by saying we need to build a new house with new toilets.    She asks me, every five minutes why we have not left to build the new house.    When I explain we cannot afford to, it is too late, we need to talk to other people to get help with building, etc., she breaks down and begins sobbing.    I have attempted to distract her with the possibility of building a house out of blocks (too breakable, she says) or drawing the house she imagines.    The drawing idea was useful, but she returned quickly to the demand that we must go start to build the new house.    Even the act of drawing made her suddenly break down and start sobbing when I asked her what one particular squiggle was.    She explained later that it was a sign for ""Katy's house"" and pointed to another ""sign"" on the other side that said ""Katy's Restaurant.""I am puzzled by all of this.    Her sister has just recently finished second grade.    My four year old will go to pre-school in the fall (which delights her).    She is strong-willed and often pouts when she does not get her way, but the incoherent sobbing about a house seemed uncharacteristic.Her father and I are in the middle of a divorce.    I suspect that is part of it, but I don't know how or why (never took child psychology).    He has a female ""friend"" that the girls spend a great deal of time with (in fact, they spend more time doing things with him and his female friend than they do with him and me, though I do my best to spend as much time with them on the weekends and in the evenings as I can manage).The best I can come up with is that perhaps this is her brain's way of coping with what is clearly a broken family.    Maybe she imagines that, if she can build a new house and fix the things that are wrong, she will be able to fix her family too.If you have any ideas, please help."

I asked him what the chances were of malignancy given that my CA125 was 68 and has gone up to 81.    He was very non-committal - said that was why they were operating so soon and refused to be drawn - kept repeating they would need to see the lab results.    I know he's right but so often you hear of a more reassuring attitude. Am I reading too much into his lack of being positive?    Does it sound like he thinks it could be malignant?

DEMO	BURNING VAGINAL & PERINEAL/ ANUS ITCH?	"Hey everyoneI am new to this website and I hope I am in the right forum.6 months ago I got diagnosted with Pelvic Inflammatory Disease and was treated for it with Antibiotics. Ever since I have not had any kind of problems , pain or irritation.But a little over 2 weeks ago I started having a tooth ache and got prescribed Antibiotics again - and I noticed that the Antibiotics I got prescribed was AUGMENTIN (875 mg/ 2 x a day for 10 days). I never took that kind of antibiotics before and was sceptical.3 days into taking those antibiotics i started having a burning, itching sensation in my vaginal area - first just the outside of the vagina. Two days later the burning got worse and it affected the inner labia, even the area around the vaginal opening. BUT I had/ have no vaginal discharge at all.The burning and itching and irritation got so worse that I could barely walk, wearing slips was painful and urinating was too and everything down there was red, sore and swollen and the labia felt rubber-like numb.So i went to the OB/GYN and he told me that this is an yeast infection - most likely caused by the antibiotics.He told me that he could either prescribed an ointment or that I could just go and get the over-the-counter stuff - and I did. Got the Monistat 1 Action Pack - and after inserting the ovale ""Thing"" i noticed that the burning and itching got quite better after two days.Yesterday, 5 days later the itching and burning is still there - not as bad as before but still there, and even affected the Perineum and Anus Area. Every Bowl Movement is quite painful - it burns like hell.So I got the Vagisil Maximum Strength Creme - and man, I could not take that burn - that was like fire when i put that creme on and I had to take it off immediately. So I started just sitting in the tub with cold water to ease the itch and burn - which helps. not for long, but at least a little.I even noticed that the skin around the vagina and the anus looks reddish, some parts scaly/ flaky like.And I do want to mention that I have psoriasis (affected in palms of my hands, under my feet, legs, elbows, knees, head skin and under my fingernails). And I am concerned that maybe my genital area got affected now with psoriasis.I went back to the OB/GYN and told him about the symptons that are still there - but he said that an yeast infection will take at least 7 days to heal to wait a few more days.But I am really concerned now. It still feels painful when i just walk, every ""tight"" clothing causes more irritation and bowl movements/ urinating are a nightmare and at night it rarely lets me fall asleep cause the burn and irritation make it almost impossible to find some rest.I am a single mother and have to take care of my boy all day and being in such a discomfort makes the every day life with a 3 yr old harder than it already is as a single mother.Please - if you have any idea what it could be - is it an yeast infection like the OB/GYN said/ thinks - could it be psoriasis (anybody here diagnosed with it?) or something else or where to go to/ whom to seek for medical help - PLEASE let me know your thoughts.I am very thankful for taking the time to read my post and wish all of you a great day.NEAMAE"

Expose The Truth About Ã¢ € ˜AmericaÃ¢ € ™s Fraud PresidentÃ¢ € ™ to UNLIMITED Households!Under the plan, China would own U.S. businesses, U.S. infrastructure and U.S. high-value land, all with a U.S. government guarantee against loss.Yu Qiao, a professor of economics in the School of Public Policy and Management at Tsighua University in Beijing, proposed in 2009 a plan for the U.S. government to guarantee foreign investments in the United States.WND has reliable information that the Bank of China, ChinaÃ¢ € ™s central bank, has continued to advance the plan to convert ChinaÃ¢ € ™s holdings of U.S. debt into equity owned by China in the U.S.The Obama administration, under the plan, would grant a financial guarantee as an inducement for China to convert U.S. debt into Chinese direct equity investment. China would take ownership of successful U.S. corporations, potentially profitable infrastructure projects and high-value U.S. real estate.The plan would be designed to induce China to resume lending to the U.S. on a nearly zero-interest basis.However, converting Chinese debt to equity investments in the United States could easily add another $1 trillion to outstanding Obama administration guarantees issued in the current economic crisis.As of November 2012, China owned $1.17 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities, according to U.S. Department of Treasury and Federal Reserve Board calculations published Jan. 16.Concerned about the unrestrained growth in U.S. debt under the Obama administration, China has reduced by 97 percent its holdings in short-term U.S. Treasury bills. ChinaÃ¢ € ™s holding of $573.7 billion in August 2008, prior to the massive bank bailouts and stimulus programs triggered by the collapse in the U.S. mortgage market, dwindled to $5.96 billion by March 2011.Treasury bills are short-term debt that matures in one year or less, sold to finance U.S. debt. Holdings of Treasury bills are included in the $1.17 trillion of total Treasury securities owned by China as of November 2012.In addition to a national debt in excess of $16 trillion, the U.S. government in 2010 faced over $70 trillion in unfunded obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits scheduled to be paid retiring baby boomer retirees in the coming decades, with unfunded obligations showing no sign of being reduced with Congress at a deadlock over reducing federal government spending.Yu Qiao observed that if the U.S. dollar collapsed under the weight of proposed Obama administration trillion-dollar budget deficits into the foreseeable future, holders of U.S. debt would face substantial losses that the Financial Times estimated Ã¢ € œwould devastate AsiansÃ¢ € ™ hard-earned wealth and terminate economic globalization.Ã¢ € Ã¢ € œThe basic idea is to turn Asian savings, ChinaÃ¢ € ™s in particular, into real business interests rather than let them be used to support U.S. over-consumption,Ã¢ €  Yu Qiao wrote, reflecting themes commonly suggested by Chinese government officials. Ã¢ € œWhile fixed-income securities are vulnerable to any fall in the value of the dollar, equity claims on sound corporations and infrastructure projects are at less risk from a currency default,Ã¢ €  he continued.The problem is that, in a struggling U.S. economy, China does not want to trade its investment in U.S. Treasury debt securities, with their inherent risk of dollar devaluation, for equally risky investments in U.S. corporations and infrastructure projects.Ã¢ € œBut Asians do not want to bear the risk of this investment because of market turbulence and a lack of knowledge of cultural, legal and regulatory issues in U.S. businesses,Ã¢ €  he stressed. Ã¢ € œHowever if a guarantee scheme were created, Asian savers could be willing to invest directly in capital-hungry U.S. industries.Ã¢ € Yu QiaoÃ¢ € ™s plan included four components:China would negotiate with the U.S. government to create a Ã¢ € œcrisis relief facility,Ã¢ €  or CRF. The CRF Ã¢ € œwould be used alongside U.S. federal efforts to stabilize the banking system and to invest in capital-intensive infrastructure projects such as high-speed railroad from Boston to Washington, D.C.China would pool a portion of its holdings of Treasury bonds under the CFR umbrella to convert sovereign debt into equity. Any CFR funds that were designated for investment in U.S. corporations would still be owned and managed by U.S. equity holders, with the Asians holding minority equity shares Ã¢ € œthat would, like preferred stock, be convertible.Ã¢ € The U.S. government would act as a guarantor, Ã¢ € œproviding a sovereign guarantee scheme to assure the investment principal of the CRF against possible default of targeted companies or projectsÃ¢ € .The Federal Reserve would set up a special account to supply the liquidity the CRF would require to swap sovereign debt into industrial investment in the United States.Ã¢ € œThe CRF would lessen AsiansÃ¢ € ™ concern about implicit default of sovereign debts caused by a collapsing dollar,Ã¢ €  Yu Qiao concluded. Ã¢ € œIt would cost little and help the U.S. by channeling funds to business investment.Ã¢ € ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1776Nation.comJerome R.

GOAL	Forum-MD's in the STD forums and not here?	"Many have posted questions in many other forums, however, while scanning through the site, and the forums, it seems the MHI-MD's are too busy answering STD questions to bother with any others. All the latest questions are being ""commented on"" by other users, vs. being ""answered"" by the MHI MD's.    I think they deserve answers, just as quickly as the STD's forum, don't you?Not just the weight loss forum, but over 50 unanswered questions in the women's issues forum, over 50 in thyroid, respiratory, and nutrition.    I am wondering why there are only moderators or real Q & A on only STD and UROLOGY???    Maybe these are Male forums, with male interests, so the others are left behind.    I seriously don't get it. HELLO? Is anyone there?"

DEMO	vaginal ultrasound 'calcified lesion'	I have had recent bleeding between periods - and had an ultrasound last week which showed up a white area (small mass) in my uterus on the screen.    It was suggested then to do a vaginal ultrasound - this showed a clear picture of this white area.    It is only small 1 x 1cm - My doctor cant get me into a gynaecologist for 2 1/2 weeks.    I am fairly concerned about this and wonder whether I should be having further tests prior to the gynae visit ?    Also the ultrasound reporter suggested a further vaginal ultrasound but my GP said not to do this and wait for my specialist appointment. Curious as to whether other people have had similar lesions appear on ultrasound and their outcome.

PREG	Folliculitis caused by oral contraceptive	Hello, I have tried using oral contraceptives with progesterone and estrogen to feel safer when something goes wrong with condoms, but about 25 days after the start of treatment, i started to have folliculitis in the hip region (buttocks and groin). They are many and big. I usually do not shave my buttocks, then I exclude the possibility of a problem related to that. I've tried changing the medicine to try another kinds of estrogen, but the problem persists and now I'm trying one that is based only progestrone. I'm afraid to go wrong with this one too and not remain me any options. I wonder what has caused this and what should I do? I do not want to depend solely on condoms because they can burst.

DEMO	Birth Control, High Blood Pressure, Tilted Cervix	"I am 21 and have really high (like 160/107 high) blood pressure.    My nurse practitioner's answer is to try going off of the birth control pill and see if it will change.    However, I went on the pill seven or so years ago because I have really intense periods (passing clots, bleeding through clothes/pads, horrible cramps throughout period).    Someone in the OBGYN department at the medical school associated with my undergrad eduction said that my ""inverted"" cervix probably leads to the awful periods and could lead to scarring if left untreated.    Basically, I'm wondering if I should try to find a way to stay with hormone treatment, especially as my mother got high blood pressure in her 30s because of a heart rate issue?    I really want to have a family at some point...    I don't want possible scarring to interfere with that.    Thanks."
TRMT	Dizziness and fuzzy sight	Hey everyone.A few days ago I was working out in the night and started feeling dizzy and getting fuzzyness so that at some points I couldn't even see anything except the fuzzyness. Does anyone know why this would have happened? My day was pretty standard. Workout in the morning, go to study, and workout again. I had the same amount of cals as I usually do, (1000) so I don't think it was that. I don't eat red meat very often, maybe once a fortnight? Could that be a problem? Also, I felt less dizzy after I had some sugar. So not sure on this one!Thanks,Skye.
FAML	Son has overly sensitive belly button	Please help!    My son, who is 8 and has been diagnosed with Sensory Integration Disorder, has a very strange issue with his belly button and lately with his underarms.    He cannot stand for anyone to touch his belly button, even if he laughs, he says it is very painful.    He holds his hand over his navel even if he has a shirt on, and now he says if his arms are not tight to his body he has a feeling that someone is touching him under his arms and it hurts.    He crys often about this. He cannot write sometimes because of this sensatrion he has. Please, can you give me any direction to what I can do to help this little guy?    No one seems to know or have ever heard of this. He is a very bight kid, has a hard time making friends because of the way he acts, even though he cannot help it.    Thank you in advance.
PREG	What is the main reason IVF does not work for people?	"I will be doing our first IVF treatment starting this month.    Of couse, as you know, it will be a couple month process with my protocol.    We have been TTC since July of 2007.    It is secondary infertility on my part, however, my husband has never had children.    I have three children from a previous marriage.    All were normal, easy pregnancies.    I also didn't even have to try to get pregnant with them, as they were all ""surprises.""    My husband and I were married in June of 2007 and have been trying ever since.    We have done two IUI's with Clomid and we have done one round of injectables with IUI.    I have had an HSG and a Lap, both normal.    I have had my prolactin, thyroid ( I think that was the same test?) FSH and progesterone checked.    All normal.    My husband has had two seman analysis which were ""normal"".    On one occasion, when I was getting our second IUI, my husband was asked by my RE's nurse if he had had a SA done, and we had to remind her that he had in fact had one.    She said they looked sluggish that day, so that has always haunted me.    We have not miscarried, I have completly normal perfect 28 day cycles, I temped for a very long time which revealed nothing.....We are at the point where we think the reason we are not getting pregnant, and our RE agrees, is his sperm is not penetrating my egg.    No conception is taking place, no fertilization is taking place.    So, I guess what I need to know is, what is the main reason why IVF does NOT work for some patients?    I have been reading and the main reason I see is egg quality.    We are not going to know my egg quality until I go in for my retrieval.    I responded well to Follistim, and for the IVF I will be doing Follistim and Menopur, so if egg quality is my issue, I am hoping that will help.    My youngest child turned 7 this past July....so it hasn't been that long that I conceived her.    I am 33 years old.    (turning 34 in March)    I am 5'2, 115 pounds, in great health, I work out.....I guess I am just asking, what reasons are most common for IVF not working?Thanks so much for your help and insight....I'm just nervous...."

GOAL	Accuweight	Has anyone tried accuweight?    You have beads put behind your ear and rub them 40 times every odd hour.    Stimulated hypothalumus to think you are not hungry and not cutting calories.    You have 1 1/2 lb veggies and 2 servings fruit each day for 2 days and 20 oz of milk each day for two days and back to veggies days and so forth.    It is a quick way to loss weight and since your body doesnt realized it has had it calories cut so dramatically you are being very healthy.. You body starts eating at the BAD fat and leaves alone the good fat.This is how it was explained to me.People have lost 95 lbs in 6 months... and kept it off for years.Anyone?
TRMT	boyfriend has LARGE LUMP on inner thigh CHANGING COLORS!	my boyfriend has the same issue but it grew twice the size.    He's had the lump on his inner thigh and    can't feel one of his legs/left leg.    I'm 5'9'' and have long skinny fingers and long hands, it's at least the length of my hand.    However it's gotten black and blue, then turned purple now it's black.    He's getting blue spots on other parts of his leg.    Could it be a blood vessel problem and a nerve problem? Could it be a circulation problem? Could it be SKIN CANCER?! HE'S 34 GOING ON 35! ANY IDEA ON WHAT CONDITION IT COULD BE?!
FAML	My 5 year old is wetting his pants	My 5 year old son just started kindergarten 2 weeks ago. I have had a problem with him wetting his pants for awhile now. It comes and goes sometimes he wets everyday and sometimes he will not wet for weeks. When he wets it is not like he completly wet his pants it is like he leaked and just the front is wet. This does not bug him at all. He claims that he does not even feel that he is a bit wet. I have taken him to the doctor and had him tested for everything. His doctor put him on Ditropan. I did not use it because he stoped wetting his pants. Now He is wetting at school everday. I do not know what to do. The school wants him in pull ups and he refuses to go to school if I put one on him. The doctor said to give him the medicine but i dont think that he needs it because this just comes and goes. I have tried everything from not saying anything to him about wetting to taking things away, offering rewards, doing stickers. WHAT DO I DO!!!!
FAML	child averse to food and milk	my grand daughter who is    4 year old, do not show any interest or whatsoever to take food or milk right from the early days.

Thats    all.Not more than that. Please advise us how to turn the mind of the child to eat properly the food    and drink milk regularly.

PREG	Clomid, 8 follicles, positive hpt, now dropped hcg level	Hi all:    I took 100 mg Clomid this month (doc prescribed) and actually produced 8 follicles at least, we saw them with ultrasound.    On cd 26 I had a big bleed, heavy in the morning, full of clots, ended that night, dark red.    HPT showed a strong positive (I took hpt because I had a hunch).    cd 27 had quant hcg of 14,500, cd 29 had hcg of 13,500.    Ultrasound showed a gestational sack measuring large with no heartbeat (but come on!    I should only be 4 weeks!).    I think the tech was an idiot but that's another story.    US also showed alot of ovarian cycts and enlargment of the ovaries (ok- the Clomid worked WAY too well for me so we will not repeat again). Doc told me I will miscarry because hcg declined.    I have no symptons, no carmps and no bleeding.    I have preg sympsons of sore boobs and a little nausea.    My questions is 3 fold, (1) I think the big bleed cd 26 was probably a result of the ovarian hyperstimulation and the cycts must have been bleeding, (2) can an hcg that high (3x the level where I should be) maybe have dropped as I might have fertilized multiples and some are not taking, (3) if there is a gestational sac at 4 weeks maybe it's a little big but we should not see anything in it yet?    Anybody out there with anything like this story with a happy ending??    My lmp was 12/4.    Thanks for any feedback ;)

GOAL	advice wanted please	"my child has an autistic spectrum disorder and a hearing impairment When they returned home by taxi 2 and half weeks ago, they reported that 2 children at school had pulled them to the ground and that one of the children had forceibly hit their head onto the playground floor.    My son said that he told the teachers gave him an ice pack, we were not notified and he completed the day at school.    My son complained he had a headache and that he could not see properly anymore when he returned home from school. He had a bump on the back of his head. We took him to a and e who admitted him to hospital with a head and eye injury.    We have been advised that he has occlusions in his left eye, that he has double vision.    He is due to have his optic nerve tested to assess damage.    does anyone know of any good sources of information about head injury causing these types of damage to vision.    Also is there anything we can do to improve his vision as he is now unable to read his comics/books, write,and play his nintendo/lego etcMy son has now has now been refered for an mri.     his head injury happened on 28 november 2007, how likely is it that anything will show up on a scan now?is it possible to have difficulity with what you see and it be related to just your brain not your eyes?also he is saying that his dinners dont taste the same anymore and he keeps starting to talk and then saying ""whats that word?"" or he says something and then comments ""i did not want to say that word"".we have noticed that when he looks at objects with both eyes or his left eye then he is saying that red things are orange and that his spongebob toy has gone green.    However when he covers his left eye and looks just with his right eye then his colors are normal again. Could these things be related to head injury?"
FAML	Six year old daughter constantly argues...	"My daughter is six. She is a ""middle"" child, two older brothers (12 and 9) and one younger (5). She is very grown up which, for the most part, I am grateful. She can clean her room, takes her own baths/brushes her own teeth/gets herself dressed, etc... She does very well in school. Her teacher says she is very bright and she rarely needs help on homework. 95% of the time she is the perfect child...but there is that 5% of the time that makes me nuts. She talks back. Not in an ugly way but like tonight I told her to go to bed and she said that her older brothers ""aren't in bed yet."" Or if I ask her to take something back to her room or whatever she will point out that so and so has something in there that THEY aren't taking back. We were leaving my mom's tonight and all four kids were acting like clowns. I said ""Stop jumping and screaming. You all are acting like two year olds."" She walked off and I heard her say ""Two year olds can't talk."" I just really wanted to spank her for that smartmouth! But I've tried that and it does NO good. She also whines a lot and cries EVERY morning when it's time to get up and get ready. She has started many a day with a spanking for turning her tv on and standing in front of it when she is supposed to be getting dressed or for laying back down when she is supposed to go eat breakfast. To make it worse she ""tattles"" on my to her father when I spank her and he gets mad at me. He is very hard on the boys but rarely punishes her. Last week she rubbed her fingers on her bottom and then waved her hand in her 9 yo brother's face. Her dad thought this was funny. I had to be the heavy and punish her for it."

SOCL	Enlarged Cisterna magna detected during Congenital Anomaly scan	Hi,My name is Jade, I am 30 years old and is on my 32nd week of    pregnancy. This is my first pregnancy. I had my CAS on my 20th week and they found a choroid plexus cyst on the left part of the brain. My OB-Sonologist recommended that we do a follow up scan every 2 weeks to monitor the cyst. On my 30th week, the choroid plexus cyst was gone but she found that the baby has an enlarged cisterna magna instead in the left. There are no other anomalies found. I also underwent Biophysical Score for my baby and the same result was found - enlarged cisterna magna. I tried to check the internet what this means because this was not fully discussed by my OB-Gynecologist. I am now worried because most explanations I read about enlarged cisterna magna relates it to high risk of Trisomy 18, 13 and Hydrocephalus and a high risk of fetal mortality. Ultrasound result showed that I am conceiving a baby boy. I also had premature contractions recently so I had to be in complete bed rest.Can you please enlighten me about this. What are the chances that my child would survive, or would be normal?Thanks a lot.Worried mom,Jade

FAML	impossible	I can't get my son to stop talking back....he picks and picks.    HE WILL NOT STOP!    It usually starts with homework.    He procrastinates really bad.

FAML	Out of control 4 yr old- Mother and dad do not do anything	"Hello- New topic for me- My neighbors have a 4 yr old boy whom I babysit and see while visiting (I'm friends w/ the mom) The little boy is very smart, but yet, his behavior is unbelievable. He is in total control of his mother, and what I have seemed to noticed, he does not like his mom to pay attention to anyone else but him. If we are talking in the kitchen, he has to be right there in the middle of us, while there are other kids, the dad in the living room... While I ask him to let his mommy have adult time, he will start screaming and crying at the top of his lungs, he will throw things, use the F word. He will get so upset, he will litterally fall to the ground like a 2 yr old having a temper tantrum. He always wants to do what the adults are doing (I know kids are curious) but, it gets to the point where he hurts himself. His mom was cooking and he wanted to ""Flip the eggs"" like mom. Mom kept telling him to get away from the stove because the stove is hot, and he could get hurt. He looked right at her then stuck his hand right on the tip of the pan. He will not listen, EVER- When I babysit, I set rules. Example, when we were outside, I said he couldn't leave the yard. He looked at me and ran right down the side walk. When I went to get him, he tells me he fin hates me, then the temper tantrum comes. The mom also has a 2 yr old who does the same. She actually had a nervous breakdown and spent 5 days on the psych floor. The father is never home, but the mother never ever grounds, gives him time out. There is NO winning, reasoning w/ this child. You can be nice as nice, give him the 3 second count, and he will not listen. I stopped babysitting, but when I still visit- its total caos. Stopped visiting, but when I call, we cant talk cause the kids are screaming so loud we can't hear each other. I tried to give the mom advice, but she doesn't listen and just gives him his way, no matter what. When they were leaving the other day, she stopped real quick, I was standing outside her car while she was asking me something, and the 4 yr old kept screaming, ""MOMMY! GO! I WANT TO GO!"" And because she was talking real quick, he took his chocolate milk and just DROPPED it to splatter everywhere... (Which she wouldn't let him have, but he won) Is this normal? My daughter didn't act like this, all kids are different, though. Is it the parents? What would be the best advice to give her w/ out offending her parenting skills... I'm telling ya, this would be the biggest show for the Nanny- I have never, ever seen a four year old act like this... EVER-    Thank you."

SOCL	really need some advice and have no one else to turn to :(	I've been with the same man for over a year now, hes almost 33 and im almost 21... in the beginning of our relationship i was a bit crazy, drank every night, loved to party, ect. i did alot of things im not so proud of, but never cheated on him.he eventually got me out of that lifestyle and things got better.. i did however talk to my sons father on more than one occasion and things went beyond the point they should have a few times. he lives almost 2000 miles away so everything between him and i was done via phone/email. my boyfriend found out each time it happened but we got past it and remained together. throughout our whole relationship my boyfriends sister and her son haved lived with him. and they have a very odd connection. the child calles him daddy, and they act as if theyre married. they share finances, go out to eat together, ect. thats always been a touchy subject with me but ive tried to get past it and am now currently living with them for the 3rd time... babysitting him during the day while they both work................ i actually even up and left him because of the sister situation and i seriously though something sexual was going on between them... and went back to my ex states away to try and work things out for our child's sake , ended up staying there 3 weeks, found out he had been meeting up with girls offline and left him and came right back to my current boyfriend. him and i did have sex (if thats what you want to call it :/) lasted all of 30 secends and me asking him to stop... the love just wasnt there and he knew it. and my bf knows every single aspect of the whole situation.. that was over 3 months ago andi havent talked to him since, and dont plan on it. since ive been back ive noticed my boyfriend acting very odd and had a very bad feeling and one day i was on his PC and noticed it was still logged into his email acct and so i opened it up and found out he had been talking to other females and had tons of nude pictures from all of them. i was devistated and confronted him and he blew it off like it was nothin, apologising for not telling me females sent him random pictures. he asked me to forgive and forget because of the things ive done to him in the past and so ive been trying.. he even deleted his fb account and email acct he was using. but made a new one and said hed give me the password.. but never has. even though he has my fb pass and email pass :/ i know he talked so other females and im deathly afraid hes still doing the same things behind my back but im petrified to confront him and i dont know what to do :( he took psycology and hes very smart and is always a step ahead of me in everything.. its so hard to talk to him because he always has an answer for everything and its justifiable.. but hardly makes sence.. and the whole sister thing is eating me alive. everywhere we go she goes... and he refused to make her find her own place even though shes 36 years old and has a great paying job.... please help me :((((!!!!!!! i love him with all my heart but i dont want to waste my time if hes just skrewing me over :(

TRMT	Same side pain & pressure...please see pic posted  other post too	Report noted healed right orbital    fracture but nothing about how my eyeball is bulging & that's been one of my biggest complaints in the past few months especially...
FAML	My son is 3 yr 4 months and doesn't understand everything	My son's age is 3yr 4months.We tested his ears and doctors told that there is no hearing problem.He responds only if he wish to otherwise not always though he listens.If we say chocolate he immediately responds even if he watches tv.He listens and turn up even for a small sound like train noise, plane, calling bell (he likes trains, planes etc) and responds immediately but if we call he doesn't respond most of the times immediately.We think that he doesnt understand what we r saying.He just remembers few words that we use and does things without understanding. Also,we think he lives only in present tense but cannot recollect about past.For ex, if he goes to school and comes back and we ask where have u been and what have u done there he doesnt understand what we say.He doesnt understand the question.If i ask his brother(younger 1 year old)    name sometimes he says but sometimes he repeats the question and sometimes just say brother. That means he doesnt understand. He asks for water, if he feel hungry he asks for chocolate, biscuit ,chips etc but not food.He    can say that he wants to go to toilet and he goes    himself.He watches tv and laptop for hours. He asks for the particular rhymes or song by pointing out with finger and says first word. He can say numbers 1-10 and a-z as well as identify them. He can tell rhymes and sing songs.He can say colors. He plays with his brother. He loves his brother.He kisses him. We are worrying about him a lot. Please suggest us to improve him
DEMO	irritated skin in vaginal area	"I'm hoping someone may have insight into thisI woke up 5 days ago with slight irritation on one side of my labia... like where my thong touches. I had noticed an increase in milky discharge (with no unpleasant odor) so assumed possibly I had a yeast infection coming on.Of course I looked every 3 seconds at it and it got a little more and more uncomfortable.Night two worried me the most.. I think the monistat applied topically did it. It was still only slightly red but burning (topically only). I noticed that it would feel that way when it was in contact with my discharge.. when I was sitting down and my underwear is against it (presumably soaking up the moisture) there is very little discomfort.I also have noticed the discomfort moves around depending on how I am sitting or what I am doing. Sometimes its back on my anus (on the left side) and other times it is all the way up front on the left side above the clitoris area... again where the discharge touchesYesterday it was almost better until I took a super hot shower and used a lot of water on that area.. then my anus was stinging.. so I got the smart idea to use some lubriderm on it.. yeah hold moisture on a too moist area.. smart, eh?Anyhow, there are no bumps, no sores, no cuts, just a little bit of redness (which is on both sides actually) and then topical soreness which feels like its a bit ""raw"". It has been going on for about 5 days and is no worse (at times better)my boyfriend has never had any symptoms of anything like this before, nor have I. We havent even had ""scares"" beforeany ideas???????"
DISE	Hip pain from previous femure repair	18 yrs ago I had a severe car accident.    I shattered my right femur as well as broke my left tibia & fibula & crushed my left ankle.    At the time they had to put a rod in my femur along with screws above my knee to hold the bones in place while they healed.    I've been told that over time calcium can developed in the hip area where they put the rod in, which can be very painful.    Is this true?    About a week ago i started having pain in my right hip and lower back that radiatess around to the front of my thigh and shoots down the front of my thigh into the knee.    This pain has gotten more and more severe over the week.    It is extremely tender to the touch around my right thigh & buttock.    I can't seem to get away from the pain, it doesn't matter the position I'm in....and it hurts more if I have to stand or walk for any length of time...A LOT.    Do you have any suggestions of whether or not this could have to do with the rod in my thigh.    I also went to the chiropractor which give very little relief.

DISE	biopsy for microcalcifications	Hello,I was wondering if anyone has any advice or thoughts on my situation.    Im 42 went in for my baseline and then a call back for a diagnostic mammogram. They have found two clusters of microcalcifications that have odd shapes...kinda grain of rice looking.    Is that an indication that there is a malignancy.    I have a needle biopsy scheduled in a week and a half and Im just wondering if there are any stats on percentage of malignancy with these kinds of microcalcifications. I guess I will know soon enough but the waiting is the hardest part.
DEMO	Could I be pregnant?	My partner and I had sex three times during the week that I ovulated (mind you I wasn't aware that I did). We used condoms each time. Two of the three times that we did it he ejaculated outside, and we considered it safe. But the third time that he pulled out, the condom broke (while it was coming out) and the ejaculate pretty much went all over him (but not me). My period is about two days late now- I wonder if I could be pregnant because of that?

DEMO	head pain	about 4 years ago i slipped and fell running up my walk way and slammed my head into the cement. a couple years before that i fell out of the shower and hit my head on the toilet.

I haven't had any really bad headaches like that up until a couple months ago. i don't know whether its a    brain tumor or something?

TRMT	Gardasil/Ceverix HPV vaccine	"My daughter was a healthy typical teenager who had all required vaccines throughout her life.    When Gardasil was suggested by her new doctor, I, as a responsible parent, agreed.    She had just been given a clean bill of health for cheer leading, and then within 20 minutes she was extremely ill and has yet to recover, 1 1/2 years later.    Her story is only one of hundreds of thousands globally.    I am not anti-vaccine!    I am just anti-Gardasil and can't NOT warn others of the side effects that are written off as ""coincidental"". truthaboutgardasil.org is a site to see stories of others as well as information with proof of the hidden adverse effects of this vaccine."

GOAL	White Tongue	Hello,So I am wondering if anyone can help me figure out what is happening to my tongue.    Two days after kissing a girl I noticed my tongue had turned white.    I went to the doctor where The PA told me I had thrush and gave me Nystatin which did not help it.    Two days after that visit to the doctor I developed a real bad flu.    I went back to the doctor who then told me I did not have thrush but had a coated tongue and gave me amoxicillin for the flu and fluconazole because he said he did not want the coated tongue to turn into thrush from the antibiotics.    The medication helped rid me of the flu but the white tongue did not go away.    I have since been to the dentist who believed it was a result of tobacco use and rinsing with hydrogen peroxide which I had been doing.    I have also been to an ENT doctor who believes it is a result of acid reflux and prescribed prilosec and has me rinsing with baking soda.    Now it has been 9 weeks and none of this seems to be curing my tongue.    The doctors have told me they think it is unrelated to the girl I kissed prior to having the issue and have told me it is not contagous.    I have been tested for all STD's and do not have anything so it is not from that, and I have not used tobacco or rinsed with hydrogen peroxide since this all began.To describe the tongue, the papillae are all pretty much white.    If I brush my tongue with baking soda it pinkens it up temporarily but it always goes back to white.    Even when it is temporarily pink I can see the outline of where it will turn white again as it looks like there is a slimy coating that cant be scraped off in that area.    It covers the top surface of my tongue from the back where it is very white to the tip where there is more pink areas mixed in with the white.    It is not cottage cheese looking and the papillae are not long and hairy looking either.    Any help in answering 1) what this might be, 2) is it contagous, and 3) how can I cure it would be greatly appreciated.Thanks    for your help!
FAML	6 year old son pooping his pants	Okay at the end of kindergarten last year my son started having accidents and I was upset because his teacher was calling me all the time and told me something physiological was wrong with my son to be doing that and that he wouldn't be able to go to the 1st grade if it didn't stop. So I took him to the doctor they gave him Mira lax and that helped at first then he got to the point it was diarrhea and so I stopped the Mira lax and he would get constipated and I had to do suppositories and that was awful and still to this day he has little skid marks in his pants and sometimes not. He doesn't know when it is happening and over the Christmas break we sat him on the toilet every 2 hours for 15 mins and it helped maybe a little skid mark here and there but when school started back up it started again its not a full blown poop just a little and I have a 1 year old and he shares a room with my six year old and I make sure everything he has soiled is always put up where he can't get to it but the other day my 6 year old apparently hid a pair of under wears and my 1 year old got it I was so angry I didn't know what to do. PLEASE HELP. I am lost he has never done this before.This discussion is related to6 Year Old Defecates Pants.

FAML	Is this Normal for a 5 year old?	"Recently my family moved out of the neighborhood we lived in for several years.    My son who is five, has a friend in our old neighborhood who he has known and been ""best friends"" with since birth.    Recently on play dates, the two of them have been extemely excited to see eachother, and have hugged and kissed.     I did not think much of it until this last time when my son told me after his playdate that his friend was his ""boyfriend"" and they are going to get married.    I told him that kissing his friend was not appropriate, and that I know that they are friends and really miss eachother.    Any thoughts???"
FAML	5 year old playing dr.	My 5 year old just recently started undressing his friends. He had a play date with a 4 year old girl and while they were playing in her playroom he undressed her. When I found out (walked in on them) I was shocked, but then took him home and talked to him about other people's privacy. We had talked before about his privacy, so I explained that just like we don't want other people looking at or touching his naked body he needed to follow the same rules for other people. He said he understood and I thought that was a lesson learned... until today. We were having another play date (with a different child, a boy this time) and my son was trying to coax him into taking his shirt off. The little boy came and asked him mom if it was okay cause my son said it was; she said no and the little boy ran back into the bedroom... knowing what had happened before I decided to go check on them and sure enough when I got to the doorway my son was still trying to convince him to do this. I called him into the bathroom and I reminded him what we had talked about before and then he got really mad at me and defensive. When we came out of the bathroom the other boy was upset and wanted to go home. I know it made the little boy uncomfortable, and frankly it makes me uncomfortable, but how do I make my son see that this is not an appropriate behavior?

DEMO	A question about my herpes condition.....	Ok, I know i have posted here about 1000 times, but i really need some answers or words of knowledge. Here is a little brief history: Around the end of August or beginning of september I had unprotected sex with a guy for about 20 minutes ( one time) and then about 2 weeks later (september 15) I had sex again with a new partner ( my current boyfriend), also unprotected, I know very stupid of me. Around the last days of October, I developed a very big painful rash in between my buttocks and vaginal lips. I tought at that time that it was irritation from a maxi pad. About a week and a half later the rash started healing, but soon after I developed a smaller rash in the two sides of my vaginal opening, with red painful bumps. I also got this open tear (like a paper cut) right in the area between the vaginal opening and the anal opening. Must i add that this was the same area that I got teared when I had sex before from lack of lubrication. Up to this day, I still have this rash. It goes away for about 2-3 days and then apprears again, also with the tear. I went to planned parenthood about 2 weeks ago and tested for HSV 1 and 2 and for yeast infection. This last Friday, they called me back and informed me that I was HSV 2 negative, but HSV 1 positive. She made it seem like no big deal, and told me it was nothing to worry about. The yeast test also came back negative. my doubts are that I still have this damn rash and I do not know what is, it really is ruining me, i have not had sex since then because I am afraid. I was wondering if it might have been too early to take the test

DISE	PLEASE HELP!	Hello,I had posted question here a several times before and each time really helped me...I thanks you for then and.I thank you in advance.Around Dec. of last year I had a few unprotected oral sex with a street hookers.    We smoked coke and I recieved oral for a few hours.    That next day,    I felt this burning , tingling feeling that I had not felt before.    Then I notice the rim of my penis turn red , with a few red spots.    I went to the clinic ,    and the doctor said everything looked normal, and all my tests were negative.    Then a month later,    mid Jan.    I noticed a small white bump on the bottom tip of my penis.    I tried to squeeze , pop, itch , and just made it worse.    There was a lil pus ..but hardly no liquid of any type....It got infected and turned really red and looked like a bad pimple, then in about a week..it disappeared leaving a tiny little black dot.    I then went to the clinic again...did all the test again...( negative)...and the doctor told me that everything was normal it was just the way my skin was.    RELIEF!.Around early Feb.a month later     i noticed a red spot, on the bottom part of the head...right about the rim.    it wasn't even a bump because I couldn't feel anything. But it was fairly big...size of pen cap...maybe al lil smaller.     So for about a month I just had a red spot that was so slightly raised. Sometimes you have to have the    light shine    to really see it..the red spot alone had this shine/glaze to it..     It didn't itch or hurt and had no feeling.    I was hoping this would just go away....but i have had this since it started and now it seems worse. Now the red dot are really noticeable and when I masturbate I can even feel some sort of scab.     As I looked at it carefully it even seems like a lesion or blister.This last weeked I had a encounter for only oral sex which was unprotected.    Then I did a lot of masturbating with lotion The burning and tingling feeling appeared again.    I would constatly look at my penis because there is some discomfort, i'm not sure if its burning or tingling, or it could be both....theres even some weird pain on the tip of the penis....and a stinging feeling on the shaft and seems like my testicles hurt too. Today I spent about a hour examining my penis.....1.    That red spot thats been there for many weeks is now looking like a    lesion , blister.    2. The shaft of my penis when flacid has lots of wrinkled skin and when erect I noticed a few spots where the skin is gone. .    Kinda like a eraser burn....or a ulcer but not discolored in any way.    Could this be from masturbating...( i have noticed that my penis is sometimes dry and sticky. ).    3.    I feel burning/itching    on the penis.    I can't really pinpoint where the discomfort is coming from but when i'm sitting down , driving,    It feels like the whole penis has been dipped in ben gay.Scary thought of having std's is taking over my days.    I would read 100's of post on the forums and I would read many articles online. I'm afraid that I caught something now.....I will go in to see the clinic again but wanted your advice and thoughts about this.     Thanks

DISE	HCV RNA Quant Test	My dad's lab report for his PCR test saysHCV RNA Quant. <43No detectable level of HCV RNAThe report from Solstas Lab Partners just says it ues a Roche HCV    Test Kit by RT-PCR, but does not explain if it has a lower level of detection (e.g. 7 or 10 IU/mL) in addition to the lower level of quantification.Do you know if a test reported like this will only look to 43 IU/mL and say UND if below without checking for low levels of the virus below the quantification level? If they do check for low virus levels, what is generally the level?Thanks.
SOCL	Triggers	Hey guys sorry I have been out of the loop. My daughter was in the hospital again( whole other story) but I have a question. Is it just me, or does this whole Tiger woods thing stir up feelings in any of you who have been in his wife's situation? I have been doing SO well. Or at least trying to. My husband said he is trying to forget the past and it drives him nuts when I bring it up so I just bite the bullet but this thing is really eating at me.In our last session the therapist pulled out a pencil, he asked me what was on the top of it. Of course I answered an eraser. He asked why. I said to erase mistakes. He said who ever invented it knew that there was a need for it. That mistakes would be made. you can cross them out but still have a mark that they are there or you can erase it and it is gone. So I realized he was telling me let it go. Could have been worse so on Sunday I went out and purchased two decorative erasers, that night gave one to my husband and one for myself. I was surprised when he teared up. I made a promise that I would no longer dwell on this situation but said If he ever did anything remotely like this again I was gone. But you can not turn on Tv, radio or look at a paper without the whole Tiger woods thing coming up. It has triggered so much emotion and distrust in me again. Yesterday my husbands supervisor called our house by accident meant to call his cell #. I was at work but my daughter took the call. She freaked out on the woman b/c she saw that it was her dad's work #. Knows this woman works there too, so when the sup. asked for Joe, Kate said why are you calling him. Don't ever call him again. The supervisor was so apologetic. Said who she was and had a blond moment and called the wrong #. My daughter felt so bad she called me crying. I realize this has effected her to. I think she see's me as weak because I am choosing to let it go.

FAML	behavior problems	My son is 4. He will turn 5 in September. I am very concerned because he is having major anger outbursts lately. He recently finished preschool and is now not attending for the summer. His schedule was very rigid before June. Now, he basically has no schedule. Anger outbursts include screaming, spitting, hitting objects, throwing things, and very recently, hitting people (including me). I would have called these outbursts tantrums before this summer. Now, they seem a little more intense than a tantrum. I'm wondering if the lack of schedule could possibly be affecting his mood/behavior. He typically has an outburs when something doesn't go his way; such as having to stop playing a game so he can come to eat supper, having to stop watching tv to go run errands, having to leave his friends when it's time to go home, etc. I have tried time outs, taking privileges, sending him to his room for an extended cool down time... none of these seem to be helping very much. I am concerned that he will be starting school in the fall. I do not want these behaviors to happen at school. Right now, he does not care where he is when he has an outburst: public places or at home. It does not bother him. I would really like some advice as to how to proceed. Is it time for me to seek a doctor's help?

I it just the side where I had work done so can it still be TMJ? I can't imagine that it would only affect one side. Has anyone had this happen or have a clue what it is or if it could be connected to my appointment in any way? I hate to go back to the dentist if its not an emergency and it shoud go away. Its not really painful to the point I can't eat or have to take meds. I just can't open it that far without pain. Anyway thanks!

FAML	TV Watching	"Hello everybody. I was hoping to get some advice/feedback on a particular topic. My step-daughter has been with me and my husband for 2 days and she's going home today. During the entire time the TV has been on, and she always throws a fit when we turn it off. I am getting concerned for her, because she does look a bit overweight, and has a pretty bad attitude. On top of that, her language skills are low, and most of the time babbles. It sometimes takes us a few minutes to figure out what she's saying. She's almost 4, and will be going to school in September.Is this caused by her always having the TV on, or are there other causes such as how she's raised at home (she lives with her mother, and I'm not sure on how she treats her and disciplines her). Does anybody have any suggestions on how to sort of ""fix"" her attitude and behavior? It's getting to the point that I don't want to be around when she's here because she only causes trouble, and never listens. I know kids are like that, but this is a bit extreme.Thanks in advance for any advice."

DISE	Second Surgical Opinions & Nodule Calcification	These boards have been very helpful and I would like to thank those for their helpfullness!I have developd a solid mass/nodule (5.7x3x3.7 on last u/s) with calcification taking up pretty much my whole left thyroid lobe.    I have three other small ones also, though, those were not biospied.    The biopsy came back benign but with follicular cells within it with the pathologist stating further investigation is warranted pending clinical appearance.    My Internist had sent me to a surgeon urgently for a surgical consult for removal of my thyroid gland and the ENT surgeon was hesitant and wanted to wait a month as he thought I had acute thyroiditis.    My Internist very much disagreed.    I have had 2 ultrasounds, 1 CT scan w/contrast and now this week I am having a thyroid uptake to determine if it is a hot/cold/warm nodule.    My Internist's office had called last Friday and stated that when they retrieve the results of this scan they want to see me regarding seeking consultation from an Endocrinology Surgeon in another province (we don't have one).    I am not treated with any medications either.Now my questions: Could it be cancer even if it is a hot nodule?    Is calcification that bad and does it always lead to cancer?    If the occurance is rapid does this lean towards cancer?    Can an FNA determine noncancer/cancer follicular cells?I know it is a lot of questions, but I just want to have some sort of sense before going back to the Internist.Thanks, and......Merry Christmas!

SOCL	Knee injury advice?	I fell a few weeks (tripped over an extension cord trying to turn off my morning alarm clock) and took a real blow to my left knee. I don't think it's the kneecap, more like the very upper part of the tibia. The bruising was relatively minor and went away in a few days, but it's the swelling that concerns me -- and the pain.The swelling is not huge, but it goes all the way down to my ankle. The pain, also, is not real horrible, just a nagging ache I try to control with ibuprofen.My concern is how should I treat this injury? I have no health insurance and can't afford a doctor. The free county hospital in my area is more dangerous than no treatment at all (they are currently undergoing a huge investigation and exposure by the media and everything's in an uproar with its chairman resigning, etc. And everybody in my area knows it's a joke to try and get treatment there, anyway).So -- can you advise how I might treat this injury? It's been about three weeks since it happened and I am just wondering how long this might take to get well if I just do what I'm doing, that is, staying off of it as much as I can. I work from home, which helps, but I do have to do absolutely necessary housework-type things like laundry, dishes, changing beds, vacuuming because I'm a single mom (don't laugh, I'm 52 with a 10-year-old son).

FAML	5 y/o boy touching self constantly	Over Christmas of 2006, my aunt fell ill and is in a nursing home. I was awarded custody of her (then 4 y/o) boy. From the beginning it became evident that he had a seriuos touching problem. He has his hands on his private part oh I'd say anywhere from 30-60 times per day. I took him to the pediatrition he said there is nothing wrong.I have asked several dozen parents of boys if any of their children exhibited this behaviour, everyone has said no. We have tried talking to him telling him this is not appropriate behaviour in public places, we have tried smacking his hand to make him aware of how many times he does it, and we have even tried the scare tactic that (if he doesnt stop it will fall off). Nothing slows this down at all.I have asked other family members and this was a problem long before the emotional turnover and changes that occured.Any suggestions?Thanks!

SOCL	What Is Spirituality: 5 (Not So) Easy Steps to Happiness	"What do you think of this article?_________________I live in Los Angeles, which may well be ground zero for spiritual movements in the United States. Many such groups got their start here, and the diversity of faiths and movements is impressive - from old to new, from sincere to shady, from truly elevating to downright toxic.People engage in all manner of practice here -- singing, chanting, doing yoga, donning exotic clothes, and sometimes even going so far as changing their names or, even more drastic, getting tattoos. For the new seeker, the variety can be bewildering; to the skeptic, proof of frivolity. They can't all possibly matter, and they can't all be right at the same time now, can they?Faced with all these choices, spirituality can be a daunting concept. What does it really mean to be spiritual? A hundred people will respond a hundred different ways, so I won't pretend to have the universal answer. What I can tell you is what spirituality means to me. It comes down to five simple principles:1) Be the best possible version of you.From the day you're born, your days on this planet are numbered. At this rate, I'm guessing I've got 22,000 more to go. The good news is that during this time, there's nothing holding you back from striving for excellence in every endeavor you undertake. So give your best in your work and your friendships and infuse it all with love.So you have this extraordinary opportunity to develop your talents in all kinds of spheres. Got a knack for cooking? Pick up a cookbook and start experimenting on your friends at dinner parties. Have an ear for music? Noodle on a guitar and learn some chords. Good at languages? Listen to some audio courses and say ""get me a beer"" in 24 tongues.Some of these skills will be more fun and others will be more useful. Arguably, the most rewarding skills will be those that end up enriching the lives of those around you as well as your own. Which brings us to the second point.2) Treat others exceptionally well.The essence of spirituality is realizing that at the very bottom, all humans are much more similar than different. Therefore spirituality is not about trappings, conventions, rituals or adherence to doctrine. It's simply about how well you treat others.So if you think that those with a different creed or costume are not deserving of your compassion, then you're not really spiritual, regardless of how much prayer or meditation you put in. But if you're an atheist who's a source of elevation and enrichment to all those around you - hate to break it to you, but you're spiritual.Spirituality manifests in action, so let go of dogma and ritual. Instead, resolve to treat people exceptionally well. That is the essence of compassion.3) Practice enlightened self-interest.I've observed that when you act at all times with your long-term self-interest in mind, you usually ends up taking the most compassionate course of action. I call this the 'long-now' mindset; in fact, there's a whole group of forward thinkers in San Francisco dedicated to this way of thinking, the Long Now Foundation.Let me illustrate with an example. Let's say you want to buy a car. You may think, ""Well, I like big cars, so I'm gonna get me one of these bigass SUVs."" That's super short-term thinking. Then you think, ""Hmm, gas prices are only going to rise, so maybe I should get a smaller car."" That's longer term. Then: ""Y'know, if I'm going to have kids some day and don't want their school to be under water, maybe I should do my part to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. I'll get a hybrid."" By thinking about your self-interest a generation or two down the road, you end up doing the 'compassionate' thing.Taoist thought is suspicious about taking actions because they're good or noble - it's all about practicality. That's what I like about long-now thinking: it's less about being nice than it is about being smart.4) Think independently of circumstanceNewsflash: today, you are not just Homo sapiens, or thinking man. You are Homo sapiens sapiens, thinking thinking man (and woman).What the anthropologists who named the human race had in mind originally I can't speculate. But to me, it means that you, the crown jewel of all creation, able to peer into the depths of the universe that birthed you and fathom its origins, are capable of thought. And not just thought, but thought about thought.You can be thinking one moment, ""Aw man, that ******* just cut me off - I hate him!"" And the next second you can think, ""Well, that's silly - he's probably just late for work,"" and proceed to chuckle about the incident and continue along your merry way.What you did there was a skill unique to humans called metacognition, or thinking about thinking. In addition to your ability to have thoughts about thoughts, it's also your general ability to redirect thought independently of circumstance.If in delicate moments you've ever chosen to focus on baseball scores or George Clooney instead of the task at hand, congratulations - you have performed metacognition.Ladies and gentlemen - this is kind of a big deal.One could say that strengthening your metacognition muscle is the essence of all Eastern spiritual practice. To be the calm in the storm, to transmute hate into love, to choose the best action instead of reacting to circumstance unconsciously - these are all metacognitive skills and the goal of meditative practice.As an added bonus, metacognitive skills may also be the foundation of lifelong success, as elaborated in this brilliant article by Jonah Lehrer in this week's New Yorker. Young children who are able to suppress their urges for immediate gratification by redirecting their attention end up being much more successful as adults.5) Practice gratitude.If you're reading this now, chances are you have a roof over your head, clean clothes on your body, and a decent internet connection - i.e., a lot to be grateful for.So appreciate everything that you may have taken for granted - friends, family, food, shelter, health, fuzzy slippers. Gratitude is its own reward - the more you practice it, the better you'll feel. Make it a practice every morning to set aside a few minutes to jot down five things you're grateful for. After just a week, you'll be surprised by the list and learn a lot about what really matters to you.So if you're running around developing yourself while doing things you enjoy, making people feel great around you while keeping yourself in good stead over the long term, and controlling your thoughts so they create your happiness and success while being grateful about it all, you're not just being spiritual - you're winning at life. And you don't need any trappings for that - just you will do.......Dr. Alex BenzerAuthor, Tao of Dating for Women, Tao of Dating For MenPosted: May 28, 2009 05:12 PM"
GOAL	Tooth was sensitive to cold for 2 weeks then now it's all fine. What's ...	A couple of weeks ago, one of my teeth got sensitive to cold.    It got to the point that drinking tap water or breathing in quickly would hurt.    It wouldn't last long, maybe a second at most.    It was still this way last night when I went to bed.    All of a sudden this morning, it was fine.    I even held ice cream against it tonight and there was no pain whatsoever.    Just the slight discomfort of holding something really cold on your teeth.    I thought I might have had a leaky filing or a bad tooth but why would that just stop hurting all of a sudden?    What's going on?

FAML	My 4 year old daughter is always giving me a hard time	No matter what I do or say my 4 year old daughter is always unhappy with something.She doesnÃ¢ € ™t like her hair up, she doesnÃ¢ € ™t like her shoes/sandals, she doesnÃ¢ € ™t like that way her shirt fits, she doesnÃ¢ € ™t like the way her pants fit, she will not wear jeans at all and if I make her its a terror. She always says she doesnÃ¢ € ™t feel good when I tell her to clean her room or brush her teeth or hair. The mornings I hate most because she refuses to get out of bed. When I finally get her out sheÃ¢ € ™s crying and having a fit about it. I discipline my daughter, time outs, spankings, yelling at her (which i hate to do) taking things away, not allowing her to watch television/listen to her CD player, taking toy's away etc.. I have tried everything and I canÃ¢ € ™t take it anymore. IÃ¢ € ™m depressed and sad because I always feel angry towards her. She is very stubborn and hard headed. This morning for example was a horrible morning having a huge fit about everything. I dropped her off at daycare in tears because I canÃ¢ € ™t deal with it anymore. She doesnÃ¢ € ™t care if she hurts my feelings. I love my daughter very much but I am at my wits end with how she behaves. I really need some help and guidance. I donÃ¢ € ™t know what to do anymore. Help please
TRMT	Vitamin D: A weapon against breast cancer	"Vitamin D: A weapon against breast cancerIf you're a woman who has been diagnosed with breast cancer, all the more reason to have your vitamin-D level checked: research suggests a link between low levels and recurrence of, or death from, the cancer. Evidently, low levels of vitamin D are quite common in women diagnosed with breast cancer.Naturally, mainstream researchers are quick to back-pedal away from making a recommendation of taking more vitamin D supplements. Some doctors would actually rather give you chemo than supplementsÃ¢ € ”I guess they're reluctant to take money out of Big Pharma's pockets.Research has already noted a link between the risk of breast cancer and levels of vitamin D. But researchers are a nervous wreck over recommending getting ""too much"" vitamin D.But before they worry about ""too much,"" how about focusing on getting your vitamin D levels ""just right?"" Sure, you can always overdo a good thing, but the point is to know where you are today.I've been talking about the importance of vitamin D for years, back before it became ""trendy"" to even think about. I check my patients' 25-hydroxy vitamin D level. Levels below 20 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml) are deficient, 20 to 30 borderline, and 30 to 50 healthy. I have sent breast-cancer patients of mine to an eminent integrative oncologist in New York City. He liked to keep his patients' vitamin-D levels between 50 and 60 ng/ml. Based on the available evidence, this seems both reasonable and safe, specifically for higher risk patients with a family history of breast cancer, who have had breast cancer themselves, or who are currently being treated for breast cancer.You'll want to work closely with your doctor to get your level back up in the healthy range, which may mean multiple tests to gauge your progress. Be patient, but be diligent.DR.I"

PREG	Gallstones and Breastfeeding	About two months after I had my daughter, I started having pains under my ribs. It felt like a giant rubberband getting tighter and tighter. The last attack I had lasted a few hours and resulted in me going to the emergency room. Before I had the attacks I had a more then adequate supply of breastmilk. Now I barely make 2 ounces after 12 hours. Why is this? I can't find any information online so I thought I'd try this. I had to start giving her formula because she only gained 4 ounces over a 2 month period. It's frustrating because there is nothing I can do that I know of. Any suggestions?- first time mom

I know what you're probably thinking; What's the problem, then?Well my period usually only lasts for a few days. It's fairly light and occasionally will last UP to four days. But pretty much all of the time it's only three.I read somewhere that a womans period should averagely be about 2.5 ounces but can vary (with an emphasis on that it can be much more than that). Mine seems to be less.I see alot of concerns about periods being too long, but what about 'too' short?I might also add that the gyno mentioned my ovaries being ""much smaller"" than he considered to be average. Could that have anything to do with it?I guess my main concerns are: Is this a sign of something else that could be wrong? And could it have any effect on fertility?I just don't know..?"

TRMT	Post hysterectomy and labido	HiI am 35 with 2 young children (5 and 2) and had a hysterectomy following the birth of my 2nd little boy, my ovaries were left in place.    March this year my ovaries were removed due to benign cysts and I am now on HRT (Evo 75 mg I think).    I started on the lowest dose in March and last month was upped to the 75 mg dose as I was experiencing really bad mood swings and the hot flushes etc.    I have found my moods are fine now and the hot flushes are much better but I have no sex drive at all.    It really upsets me as well, as all I want to do is go to bed and sleep.    My husband is very highly sexed I guess and has no understanding and sex is very important to him, whereas now I couldnt care less.    Is there anything I can do?    I find I am more just going along with it as I feel so guilty about always being asleep or not interested but it all feels like a pretence and no longer that enjoyable.    I am not dry or anything and it is not painful, it is simply I have no interest in it or enjoyment.Thanks

SOCL	"18-year-old Boy labeled ""sex offender"" over ""sexting"" incident?"	"Apparently, this 18-year-old boy was dating a 16-year-old, which is still legal. She sent some nude pictures to his email as a surprise. After an argument, late one night, he got vindictive and sent some of the pictures to the contacts on her email address. The next day, police showed up and confiscated everything digital that he owned and arrested him. He is now labeled a sex offender, and will be 43 before he can approach the courts about repealing the felony charge and title.IMO, this is ridiculous. He was a jerk, absolutely, but this goes overboard, way above and beyond what he should have been charged with. This ""sexting"" (taking nude pictures of oneself and using digital media such as phones or email to send the image to others) is out of control, first of all, but to charge someone that I still consider on the edge of childhood as a sex offender over something so very small? I find it absolutely ridiculous. Obviously he was an adult and should be punished legally for doing something he had no business doing, morally or legally, but to carry the felony title of sex offender for more than 20 years? I can't even fathom how this is proportional to the crime. He also has to attended mandatory therapy once a week, discussing such issues as ""why rape is wrong"" and ""what sexual abuse does to the victim"". This seems WRONG to me, and everyone here knows that I have no tolerance for sexual predators...but I don't see this guy as being THAT bad."

She set me up to see the root canal dentist the next day. He x-ray it again and said things look good. That I have 3 options1. root canal over for 835.00 insurance will not cover.2. cut the gum and go in that way    costing over $1000. that insurance may not cover.3. removing the tooth and then having to put a bridge or inplant. All costing crazy amounts that the insurance may not cover.My question is if it looks good then why am I in pain. Why would the dentist not just do another root canal with out charging me since he missed something the first time.Which one do I choose, I need to be out of pain since I struggle with depression. The pain is only making it worse.Thank you

TRMT	Liver Transplants, cosmetic elective surgery?	"I was just sitting here fuming again because I saw a replay of the McCain/Obama debate from before the election.    The one when McCain said these people are expecting the government to pay for ""transplants and such"", these are cosmetic elective surgeries"".    I know the election is over, but I just was wondering if anybody else caught that.    Thank God he was not elected."

DISE	Just discovered problems with Ambien.	At day 19 I thought I would be completely finished with these xanax wd's but they keep coming and coming.    Late last night I watched a commercial about Lunesta and they mentioned that a common side effect was new or worsening depression.    That caught my attention so I began to frantically research Ambien and every article I've read lists new or worssening depression as a common side effect.    I've been taking Ambien off & on for the past 2 years..usually only 1/2 a tablet.    I can now see a correlation between times I've been taking ambien and an increase in my depression and I'm certain that Ambien has lengthened my detox time from Xanax.Just now...out of nowhere....my heart begain to beat as though it would come out of my chest.    Me ears started to ring and I began to instantly sweat.    What shocks me is how quickly this came on and caught me completely by surprise.    I reazlie this is apart of the detox process and probable due to an ambien side effect.

GOAL	is this dry eyes?	i had cataracts removed five years ago, now i am wondering if i have 'dry eye syndrome'? sometimes my eyes are gritty, with stringy mucus, i tend to draw my finger across the eye to get this stretchy mucus out, i know this is wrong as i introduce infection, then end up with conjunctavitis! if i am outdoors and am bending my head then tears flow down my cheeks and i    have to blow my nose.i bought some hypermelose drops which sometimes help, also i have found bathing my eyes in cooled boiled salt water, and taking a piriton tablet. so i am not sure if i am suffering dry eyes or hay fever, but this is all year round i suffer?This driving me to distraction now! i am 64 so i expect it is due to old age!!! thank you lin

FAML	Please help with my thick 12 year old son..	We have a 12 year old son.. He is taking Adderall(adderrall)for ADD and it seems to help with his concentration. However nothing matters to this child. He is in the 2 nine weeks at school and for the 3rd time we have just discovered he is not completing homework, classwork, or if he does it is failing to turn it in and then loses it as he is horribly disorganized. He seems to make everything so much harder on himself than it needs to be. He has been told he will do the work. And in the past he has had to make up the work as we told him he would. He has also acted out and had in school suspension, (shocked us as he has never acted out before to the degree he did). How do we help him? He may never see the light of day after he gets home from school today. It's no way to be a kid.
FAML	2 year old playing with his genitals.	"My son is now 3 years old-but after reading some of the topics on here-I thought I should ask about some things that have concerned me. For about the last year-he has been very interested in his genital area. He plays with himself many times-almost every time he is in the tub or in the shower or naked anytime. It has gotten so bad a few times that I noticed noises coming from him as if going in to full pleasure with the situation. I am concerned about the behavior and where at 2 years old he could have discovered this, learned this or whatever. Coming from a sexually abusive home myself-I am very keen on anything sexual like this that it literally scares me to death that I perhaps failed as a parent and exposed either one of my children (I have a 7 year old daughter too) to something so horrible.My question is--at what age is this type of ""touching"" normal? Can it happen at any age? And how do you determine if there is any other underlying issue whent he child is so young? He talks very well--but I have chatted with him briefly without bringing too much attention into the matter--but he says he learned it ""nowhere"".My biggest goal here is to make sure my kids are safe. I would like to know what to look out for and perhaps gather some reassurance to the situation--or information to make me take action.Any advice would be great.Thanks."

SOCL	Shingles	Hi everyone,I have been suffering from shingles for about 8 months. They keep breaking out.They just barely broke out to the right side of my spine. I have them on both sides of my body. They are very painfull. I have been very ill and not able to go out and feel well. Occasionally I go out for bits of time, but it is difficult because of the pain.This has been a long going process. Before shingles broke out the doctor could not figure out what I had only that my white blood cell count was high. We had done many blood tests and I had given up. Then a little rash appeared... then came on the low grade fever,headaches,and panic attacks from the pain. It was so dreadfull.Anywho it's been a while and I need some advice on who I should consult and how. My parents can not afford the doc right now. We do know a friend who is a doctor and many times weve tried to get ahold of him and we will keep trying to show him some photos and stuff.I am very unwell and really need some help. Shingles also make me very moody and depressed, i just want to know if that is normal. Theyve made me act pretty odd at times, things i wouldnt do just because of shingles depression.So anyone who can help please do and I will respond logically. Please do not suggest anything illogical like flying out of state or paying to see a doc. We do not have those oppurtunites. Thanks! I'd love advice. Has anyone else had shingles so long?

But when he got to the airport on Thursday, U.S. customs agents brought up an arrest the man had when he was 19.

DISE	secondary sclerosing cholangitis	I am a 42 year old female. Following agressive treatment and 6 week coma due to a burst brain aneurysm in 2007, I developed a secondary sclerosing cholangitis. GammaGT rose to 2800, at which point, an ERCP was undertaken to clear the scar tissue in the bile ducts. Over the next 18 months, GammaGT went down to around 60. However in the past few months it crept up to 173 again, then 2 weeks ago, I had a perforated appendix with an infection that had already spread in 3 quadrants. Following appendectomy, i was treated with IV antibiotics for 7 days. All appears to be healing well and blood work suggests infection has gone. GammaGT though has gone up to 450 again. Could this be the result (before appendix perforation and after) of the infection and antibiotics required? Any advice or information much appreciated. Thank you.

TRMT	Magnesium citrate side effects...?	Hello - I posted this question on the Nutrition forum, but since this is a group all about Mg, I figured I'd ask here too.    I've been taking Mg citrate for a week now to try and reduce my premature ventricular contractions (PVCs).    I take a 200 mg tablet in the morning and 1 tsp of Natural Calm at night.    I noticed right after I took my first dosage the first day that within a few hours of taking the Mg, I started to feel a weird internal-shaking feeling, almost like my insides were vibrating.    This has continued every day.    I only DON'T feel like this when I first wake up in the morning.    I know that Mg plays a big role in muscles, so is it possible that my body is just getting used to the Mg supplementation?    Should I continue to take it and see if the shakiness subsides?    Thank you!!

PREG	Supplements, meds & procedures which may be of benefit!!	Hi Everyone!!After having three failed IUIs, two failed IVFs, and one IVF resulting in a miscarriage I really felt I had nothing to lose in my endeavours to get pregnant and complete my family with a much wanted third child.Here is a list of what I added to my IVF (ICSI) cycle last September/October.    I am now going on 17 weeks pregnant, and pray eveything turns out fine finally.    I am not necessarily recommending any of these things, as it is important for every individual to research on their own and decide what they are willing to add to their cycle, but, I want to list them here so others can choose to look into them if they wish.Of all the medicines, supplements and procedures I added, MELATONIN, MYO-INOSITOL, VITAMIN E,    VITAMIN D3, SAIZEN, INTRALIPID, and the HYSTEROSCOPY were the ones which were added for the first time to this last successful cycle and one of them could be the answer to my ongoing BFP!There is a lot being written up about melatonin in conjunction with Vitamin E.    Also a lot of research and positive findings regarding Myo-inositol.    The other supplements all seem to have properties thought to improve egg/embryo quality.    DHEA is quite a big one being used by many women, and some fertility clinics prescribe it to older women.    The pycnogenol and Trans-Resveratrol are supplements that I notice quite a few doctors actually recommend.    As with most remedies, you will find positive research and then you'll find negative research, so before you start taking any of these, please look into them yourself, as I'd hate to recommend anything you think has an adverse effect.    I also started weekly acupuncture with a fertility expert about three months prior to my cycle.    I continued it throughout the cycle and also 13 weeks into my pregnancy.The other thing I did was ask my RE to perform a HYSTEROSCOPY prior to my last successful IVF cycle.    This is a quick procedure where a camera is inserted so your uterus can be seen.    I knew there was nothing wrong with my uterus, but the reason for me having it done was so that my RE could scrap away a piece of the endometrium so that a scar formed.    There have been statistics showing that the procedure can increase pregnancy rates, as the scarred endometrium makes implantation more successful.It also pays to have your thyroid checked, and also have a panel of immune tests taken.I also asked my RE to prescribe SAIZEN last cycle which I started taking on the day I started stimulation drugs for IVF.    (I used the micro-dose flare protocol, with 225iu of puregon, plus 2 x daily shots of buserelin).    Saizen is a human growth hormone, and is often used for older women or women with egg quality issues.    Also, this last cycle, I was prescribed with prednisone.    I started on this a day after egg collection, and kept taking it up to 7 weeks gestation.All this time, I've kept off caffeine and I think it's best to keep off alcohol.    I don't drink alcohol, and think maybe it's not great for fertility, although there's nothing documented about it.    I just feel a healthy lifestyle can only be good for our fertility.The other BIG thing I tried this successful cycle was INTRALIPID.     I was worried about the possibility of my having having acquired an auto-immune problem, as my ANA was high when it was tested in 2008.    Intralipid was given to me the day I started stimulation drugs.    It was also administered    the week I received my BFP, and then at 5 - 6 week intervals after that.    Now I'm almost 17 weeks, I won't be having anymore intralipid as my RE thinks the risk of a reaction may outweigh the benefits at this stage.Here are the supplements I used for my last cycle:-Fish oil - Omega 3, with EPA and DHAMyo-Inositol (must be myo-inositol, not just inositol)Melatonin (3mg)Vitamin E (600mg)Vitamin D3 (1,000 IU)Wheatgrass in powder formRoyal Jelly, liquid form best, but capsules still OKBee propolisl'arginineCQ10 (800mg)DHEA (75mg - 3 x 25mg daily)DIMPycnogenolTrans-Resveratrol (some RE's actually recommend this in conjunction with Pycnogenol)Green tea (one cup per day - decaffinated)MacaLow dose aspirinI used vitex for my third cycle from memory, but cut it out before doing my last cycle after reading some not so good reports on it.Now, I'm not necessarily saying any of these things contributed to my now being pregnant, but after 2 1/2 years of heartache,    in my heart, I do feel that something did help me this time.    Maybe the intralipid, maybe the hysteroscopy, or even the saizen or myo-inositol?    Who knows?Please don't start taking these things without looking into them yourself.    All I want to do is to list them, and let people know that after using them, I did get pregnant.The one last important thing is to have a fertility specialist who realistically believes in you.    My first RE unreasonably gave up on me after my first IVF failure.    He thought I should be happy with two children, and after my miscarriage last May, went on to say the only way I'd achieve another pregnancy was if I used a young egg donor.    I wasn't willing to do this, as I had two young children and wasn't ready to give up on my own eggs.    I changed to another RE at the same clinic who believed another pregnancy was indeed possible and that donated eggs should be Plan 'D'.    His confidence in my ability to have another genetic child gave me extra confidence.    And this is very, very important in this game.Good Luck everyone!!!!    Patience, perserverance and a fair amount of money (if you're like me and had to pay out of pocket) are often the key to getting pregnant with your own eggs!!!    Especially once you're over 35!XOX

SOCL	6 Health Myths Busted!	"http://shine.yahoo.com/channel/health/6-health-myths-busted-2502660/By Ramona EmersonYou know how vitamin C protects against colds? Actually, it doesn't. Warm milk contains no magic sleep aid. And hydrogen peroxide will do your skinned knee more harm than good. In their new book, Don't Cross Your Eyes...They'll Get Stuck That Way, Aaron Carroll, MD, and Rachel Vreeman, MD, both of the Indiana University School of Medicine, use hard science to disprove wives' tales that have been passed down through generations. The findings may surprise youÃ¢ € ”and save you money on cold cures (none of them work). Read on for six remedies that aren't, and the doctors' tips on what you should try instead.""Sitting Too Close to the Screen Will Ruin Your Eyes""When TVs first became popular in the 1950s, they emitted 100,000 times more radiation than they do today, so parents may have been smart to keep their kids away from the tube back then. But sitting too close to a modern set or computer screen won't do any permanent damage to your eyes. The fuzzy vision and headaches that follow a long day at the office (or an I Love Lucy marathon) are symptoms of eyestrainÃ¢ € ”a temporary condition no different from the soreness you feel after a workout. Relieve the aching with light massage around your eyes.""Vitamin C Prevents Colds""It's true that if you don't have enough C, you'll get sickÃ¢ € ”but with scurvy, not a runny nose. Carroll and Vreeman hypothesize that this bug-fighting theory began when we discovered the vitamin's link to that infamous sailors' affliction, in 1932; if C could prevent one illness, the logic likely went, perhaps it could prevent others, too. But dozens of studies have found no difference in the number or duration of colds suffered by people who take C and those who don't. What is the best way to stay cold-free? ""Nothing beats hand washing,"" Carroll says.""Jet Hand Dryers are More Sanitary Than Paper Towels""Dryer or paper towel? It's a confounding daily dilemma. Molecular biologist Keith Redway, of the University of Westminster, has done a series of experiments to put an end to the debate. He found that jet dryers actually increase the amount of bacteria on users' hands because the air inside the machines is far from sterile. The driers make the restroom dirtier, too, spewing germs more than six feet. Redway named paper towels the winner.""A Glass of Warm Milk will Help You Snooze""Even thousands of years ago, the Talmud associated drinking milk with sleep. Today there's no scientific evidence that it has the slightest impact on drowsiness. Milk does contain the nap-inducing amino acid tryptophan, but only in trace amounts. Eggs and cheese have more, but even an egg and cheese sandwich won't knock you out. (You'd probably have to eat seven of them, the authors speculate.)

GOAL	Soreness over eye	Hello,I have a question regarding this sharp, sometimes throbbing soreness above my right eye, right on the eyebrow, sort of left center.    It seems to ease off at night and when I wake up, but after 2.5 to 3 hours of being awake it starts to hurt.    I can feel it coming on slowly then all of a sudden this pain starts strong.    I would rate it as an 8 on a pain scale.    Light does not aggravate it more than any normal time and tylenol only seems to dull the pain.    Please help if you have any theories as to what this may be.    It has been on-going for the last 6 days now.
GOAL	Jaw Injury - What's going on?	I was in a bicycle accident four weeks ago, I hit my lower jaw (large lac on the LH side of the front of my lower jaw) and broke three upper teeth (LH incisors and bicuspid),nasty lac on my upper lip. I had a plastics guy do a great job on my lip and chin lacs, saw an oral surgeon the next day. He did a full pano xray on me, which I saw. No fractures of the jaw, though he did see a tiny crack in the front of my jaw. My teeth aligned properly with my mouth closed. Large bruise in the bottom of my mouth, which eventually drained into my neck and upper chest, and is mostly gone. Had three root canals the next day, crown lengthening scheduled for 3/30, will get crowns eventually. No sensitivity of my lower teeth to cold or heat. I have an invisalign tray over my uppers with 3 fake teeth while I wait.Issue: it feels like there's cord pulling on my lower jaw on the left side when I chew - not really pain, just tightness. It seems to be getting better, but I don't understand what I'm feeling. No TMJ pain or lower tooth pain, uppers all feel fine. What is going on? Did we miss a jaw fracture?
GOAL	Bright spot in vision?	"This old thread seems to contain several people who experience exactly the same problem that I am experiencing - none of them seem to have a diagnosis:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/307669;For 8 months now, I've had a bright spot in my right eye, I notice it most when I blink or when I stare at a bright background such as the sky. It ""crawls"" all the time which sometimes can be disruptive while reading. Four squares are missing on the amsler grid when I look at it with my right eye. The vision failure is at 11 o clock, near the center of my vision.I previously had a small serous blister on the foveal wall, which now is gone with no apparent scarring. Since I see this spot in a completely dark room with my eyes closed it sounds like a neurological problem more than a retinal one ,and the blister may have been unrelated at not causing this particular vision loss.An MRI was negative. The optic nerves seemed fine.Has anyone with this problem actually received a working diagnosis? I'd be happy to hear more from the people in the thread. Are there any suggestions from a medical professional how to continue or any ideas. My doctor wants me to wait and see, but it's not likely that this will go away since it has been unchanged for so long. I'd also like to understand the triggering event (I was very stressed the week the blind spot first appeared, could be related) so I can avoid doing it again."

DISE	Urine issue	for a few years now I have had pain just underneath my penis on the bottom of the shaft, from what I can feel while I urinate there is a vein of some kind that controls the urine flow. now this painful urination is sometimes on/off again but mostly every time for the past 5 years. I have seen my doctor that specializes in this area and I am clean. no STD's or infections. now while I have been living with this pain I have tried to pin pinpoint the exact area in which it occurs. each time I use the bathroom to pee; it is always in the same area, on the underside of the penis and always in the same spot.. I have tried to stand in different ways to let the urine flow properly, and have tried to ease the urine out by lightly squeezing but to no avail.    As I stated before I have been cleared on all counts of STD's.    now I am wondering if it may be the vein itself? could it have possibly closed up on me causing the pain each time? because That is exactly what it feels like. I have tried Flomax in a very small dose about 10lm over the past 3 weeks and still that did not help. One thing I have done was gong to the doctor and having them use a catheter (with a camera) to run down the inside of my penis to see if there were any obstructions. and after that session I was able to pee freely for about a day or so. however the pain returned and I had to use a catheter on my self for a week(much more painful to do when you pull it back out of your penis..)    any suggestions or    Ideas?
DISE	Should i be worried about swelling?	in august i had caught the flu from a family member and was quite bad (fever, coughing fits, crackling in chest, coughing up fluid/flem for a month even when recovering) but i never noticed any swelling of glands, nor did i have a sore throat. In october i noticed a lump in the left side of my neck and when i went to the doctor she said she noticed another swollen node on same side and that my tonsils were a tad swollen and red, she said that they can swell after an infection has gone away. Got blood tests done and said everything waas fine and that swollen nodes less than an inch and dont hurt are nothing to worry about, but a few days ago i THINK ive found a swollen lymph node on the right hand side of my groin(no tenderness and rubbery, maybe from constantly touching it so i may have aggravated it). SWhould i get a second opinion? I mean i trust the doctors ive had but im a bit of a hypocondriac.

PREG	hopngfortwns08	Well, you should be done with the ET, but probably still at the hospital on bedrest.    I'm sure that everything went very well for you. Congrats and lots of bedrest now!!I wanted to tell you about OHSS.    Here's a website I found with a neat chart to let you know symptoms and what to do.http://www.ivf.com/ohss.htmlThe website is not the clinic I used, but my clinic gave me a chart similar to this one.    Basically, my clinic had me keep a log of my weight, morning and night weight, to ensure that I didn't gain 5# in one day (your nite wt to morning wt).    Also, trying to keep salt intake down will help to keep from retaining the fluid as well.Let me know if you need any more info.    I hope I didn't scare you by this, but I think it's good to know, in case you do start to experience the symptoms.    I could tell a difference 9 days after the transfer, I felt more bloated than before the ER.    I called the office to talk to them about it on day 12 just to make sure that everything was fine.     And, like I said, the main thing is take it easy if you can, and stay hydrated.    Those two things alone will help.Good luck to you.....all the best...SSBD x 2    :)

SOCL	Obama&#x27;s signature: Is it real or is it autopenned?	"http://beta.news.yahoo.com/obamas-signature-real-autopenned-122724800.htmlWASHINGTON (AP) Ã¢ € ” It's the open secret that nobody in government wants to talk about: That cherished presidential signature that's tucked away in a scrapbook or framed for all to see might never have passed under the president's hand.For decades, presidents of both parties have let an autopen do some of the heavy lifting when it comes to scrawling their signatures. The machine was recently put to use signing a bill into law, apparently a first.Overseas and out of reach when lawmakers passed an extension of certain provisions of the Patriot Act, President Barack Obama employed the autopen to sign it, a step the White House has been mum about ever since.""I always heard the autopen was the second most guarded thing in the White House after the president,"" says Jack Shock, who had permission to wield former President Bill Clinton's autopen as his director of presidential letters and messages.Jim Cicconi, who oversaw the use of autopens for President George H.W. Bush, recalls that the plastic signature templates for the machines Ã¢ € ” yes, there was more than one autopen Ã¢ € ” would wear out from repeated use.Ronald Reagan had 22 different signature templates, including ""Ron,"" ''Dutch"" and other iterations, to boost the aura of authenticity surrounding his fake signatures, says Stephen Koschal, an autograph authenticator who two years ago published a guide to presidential autopen signatures.It's not just ordinary Americans who get the autopen treatment.Koschal says he once visited Vice President Dan Quayle's office in the Capitol and spotted a signed photograph from the first President Bush that he said had clearly been autopenned.Obama took the presidential autopen out of the closet and into a new realm.While traveling in Europe last month, Obama directed his staff in Washington to use an autopen to sign into law an extension of certain Patriot Act powers to fight terrorism. The legislation had been approved by Congress at the last minute, and there was no time to fly it to France for Obama's signature before the anti-terrorism powers expired.It was believed to be the first time a president has used an autopen to sign legislation, and that didn't sit well with a number of Republicans. Twenty-one GOP House members sent Obama a letter on June 17 asking him to re-sign the legislation with his actual signature because use of the autopen ""appears contrary to the Constitution.""Obama's team relied on a 29-page legal analysis crafted during the administration of President George W. Bush to argue that the faux signature passed constitutional muster.Ari Fleischer, White House press secretary under the younger Bush, says the Bush White House had considered using the autopen to sign a minor piece of legislation as a test case, ""but in the end Bush just kept signing the parchment himself."" Bush used the autopen for routine correspondence and photos but not on matters of importance, Fleischer said.While a number of White House aides from administrations past were willing to discuss the presidential autopen, that kind of talk is frowned upon while a president is in office.""You want to preserve the president's semblance of reaching out and being connected,"" says Shock. ""But the cold hard facts are that when you get 10,000 letters a day he can't possibly handle all that kind of correspondence himself.""It turns out there are varying levels of fakeness in presidential signatures.There are preapproved form letters with digital signatures. There are preprinted cards for birthdays and other special events. Autopen signatures generally are reserved for more personalized correspondence that doesn't score a real signature, say officials from administrations past.Obama's staff is loath to talk about his use of the autopen.The president prefers to keep the focus on the sampling of 10 letters a day that he reads from among the tens of thousands that ordinary people send to the White House. In many cases, he writes back to these people, with his own signature.But the president couldn't get around explaining how the Patriot Act got signed into law without briefly shining a spotlight on the autopen. Once that news was out, though, the White House clammed up. It declined to provide any further details about how many autopens the administration uses, what they look like, where they're kept, or who makes the machine.And don't ask Bob Olding, whose company is the leading manufacturer of autopens, to discuss his clientele.""I'm not going to help you,"" he said. ""Our customers do not want anyone else knowing they have these machines.""Olding did reveal, though, that ""when there's a major change in government, we get an uptick in business.""Olding is president of Rockville, Md.-based Damilic Corp., whose signature machines run from $2,000 up to $10,000. Hulking older versions look like a drafting table and are too big to fit through a doorway. Newer models, with microprocessors and digital controls, sit on a tabletop. But they still feature two mechanical arms that move a pen back and forth, up and down.The machines sign letters at about the same pace as does the human hand. An autopen machine that automatically signs a stack of documents can spit out roughly 500 signatures an hour; those with manual document feeders, about 200 an hour.As recently as the second Bush administration, the autopen in use was a large piece of furniture that looked like a drafting table, says Heidi Smith, who served as Bush's correspondence director for two years. She says those with clearance to use the autopen would head over to the executive clerk's office in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, next to the White House, where the autopen wielded Bush's pen of choice Ã¢ € ” a Sharpie.Autopens have been used by presidents since Dwight Eisenhower, says Koschal, and President John F. Kennedy put them to heavy use. Many presidents have had secretaries sign their names to correspondence and documents, he says.More than 200 years ago, Thomas Jefferson acquired a mechanical copying device called a polygraph that attached to his pen and made a second copy of what he was writing. Jefferson liked it so much he wrote that ""I could not, now therefore, live without the Polygraph.""It's not just busy presidents who rely on autopens. They're used by thousands of organizations, companies and government officials.Donald H. Rumsfeld got in hot water for using one as defense secretary to sign letters of condolence to the families of U.S. troops killed in action. When word leaked out in 2004, Rumsfeld said he'd done it to ""ensure expeditious contact with grieving family members.""""I have directed that in the future I sign each letter,"" he said.Other officials and candidates have fingered the autopen as an excuse to avoid taking responsibility for documents that appeared to bear their names. One was Enron executive Kenneth Lay, who was convicted of fraud, conspiracy and lying to banks despite his lawyers' arguments that he shouldn't be held accountable for documents signed by autopen. His conviction was later vacated on other grounds.So how to tell the difference between a real signature and an autopen version?Koschal says the best way to detect a fake is to lay the signature in question over a known autopen version and hold the two documents up to a light. If they're exactly the same, chances are that the top one was created with an autopen. But presidents often create multiple autopen signatures to make it less obvious when they're letting a machine do the work.As for Obama's autopen signature on the extension of Patriot Act powers, it may pass the constitutional test, but not Koschal's.""I'd pay peanuts for it,"" the autograph authenticator said. ""It's not a real signature."""

I read a lot and also use the computer for several hours a day.    Now I have cataracts and need surgery.    My doctor recommended Crystalens lenses or toric lenses. Is this the best way to restore my monovision?    I would prefer not to use glasses at all after the surgery.

FAML	Why does my 7 year old still wet himself	I have a 7 year old foster son whom still wets the bed at night. For this he wears a pull up. However the problem that concerns me is that he occassionally wets his pants during the day. This will happen both at home and school, and at least once a week on average. When questioned its because he didn't want to stop what he was doing to take time out for the toilet. He could be watching TV, playing video games, crafts at school or playing with friends. I can understand maybe the playing with friends and it getting to excited to want to stop and go use the facilities. However; its the watching TV or playing video games at home and just urinating on himself as well as whatever hes sitting on, the floor, beanbag or sofa that I don't understand. Surely he knows hes peeing on himself. Also he doesn't get up to change until hes told to. We have rewarded and punished by taking away what it was he was doing during the accident (such as if he was playing games during the incident the game is taken away for a short time). We have purchased a special watch that vibrates the wrist to alert him its toilet time and its set for 6 different times throughout the day, as well as remind him verbally to use the toilet. This worked for a very short time, but now we're back to the same ole thing. We don't yell or get angry but this is getting very frustrating. What can be done for this lack of responsibility and self control.
SOCL	How many of you women....	"Have ever, or regularly, masturbate in order to ""prime"" yourself before intercourse??This might seem like a silly question, but to me, and I would assume to most men, the idea seems a bit odd, if only because the end result would be a negative one for most guys who might try this tactic. I don't mean masturbating until you get off. That would make a little sense for a guy who might want to last longer, to masturbate shortly beforehand, since the second one always takes longer than the first.I'm talking about just masturbating enough to ""get yourself ready"", I suppose?? I mean, if I did that, it would be horrible for my wife because I would be ready to explode in no time after getting started (Which can already be an issue as it is).But I do know you ladies are different in terms of sex and reaching orgasm, so I COULD see where it makes sense. So again, do you normally do this? Or do you at times, depending on the situation? Or is thie idea of this just as proposterous to most women as it seems to a man?? Let me know..."

TRMT	is it normal to have a little piece of my olvery left with fallopian tube and olv...	Hi i am    33 years old i had my hysterectomy done in 2006 with them taking out my uterus and left olvery i had endometriosis bad so a year later he took out my other olvery with him stating to me that the pain should go away since he had gotten everything out. Things seemed to be getting better but about six or eight months later i started having stomache pain again not thinking it should have anything to do with my hysterectomy so i started seeing my colon specialites to make sure i didnt have endometriosis on on colon or any other things that might be going on so i had three ct scans and nothing showing up on any except for one where it looked like i might have a kidney stone. my colon dr put me all diffrent kinds of medicine for over a year. I ended up getting my appendix taken out last week and the dr had to get a ogbyn to help asist because he thought he had found a piece of my fallopian tube that was all nuckeled up irritaing my kidneys, my appendix was just fine but they still removed it. the pathology report came back and it stated no fallopian tube but piece of olvery that formed a olvarian cyst. Now i do believe when a dr tells you they got everything out and that things should be getting better shouldnt come back and bite ya. when a diffrent dr has to fix what one didnt do. for the last year and a half i have been dealing with bad stomache pain and i have a daughter and    twin boys    and not being able to get out and play and do certain things with them really upsets me.I have alot of people telling me that i have a law suit but im not sure if i would have a case or not. Has anyone ever gone threw something like this or close? please help

FAML	No discipline technique left to try on my 3 yr old.	We have done all, tried all we knew and heard to do to get our 3 yr old little boy to mind us and be a normal little boy. I know that this age can be trying i its self, but I am finding myself more regularly hoping someone in the family will take him for a couple days, or I just think to myself at times I just want to run away. I love our little boy with all my heart and I know he has it in him to be good, but ther seems to be no end in sight to his very very mean and cruel behavior. He used to listen somewhat good before our second child was born almost 18months ago. Now on a daily basis as soon as he wakes up it is literally not even 5 minutes later and I am already having to tell him repeatedly not to hit his brother, not to throw things, not to scream. I am 6 months pregnant with our third child and I am getting scared to think of what he might try to do to this sibling. I have tried everything from sitting down and talking to him, to time out, taking toys away, sending him to his room, and I have spanked him a couple times for the behavior but now more latley I feel like I am yelling at him all day long, waiting and praying for naptime and bedtime to get here soon because I feel like I am at my wits end with what I can do. He doesnt even attempt to stop what he is doing unless I stand up, then he runs away but doesn't stop. He tells me to shut up when I scold him for hitting the 18 month old or when I tell him not to play with the plug ins and such. I don't knwo what else I can do. I read a post on here saying these actions could be an early sign of a mood disorder. Mood disorders run deep and widely spread in my family. I have had therapists tell me I was Bipolar and some that say I suffer from severe depression. Could I have seriously given such a horrible trait to my child so early in life? Are there more specific signs that I need to be watching for? i don't want my 3 yr old to wind up having to be medicated for the same thing I am at such an early age. I am also concerned about the behavior he has already taught my second child becasue he already beats his head on things when he's mad and he throws and hits whatever is closes when he is mad. please help me understand better of all of this. It is so stressful and I just want to enjoy my little guys while they are still so young, but I can't enjoy being stretched to my limits every single day, every hour and almost every minute he is awake. If he does wind up having some sort of mood disorder, how do they treat it in toddlers and how safe is the medicine if needed? Just asking because my little brother had adhd really bad when he was young and they gave him ridlin, howver its spelled, i hated the way he was on that medicine. It was like he wasnt fully there and I dont want that for my son.

FAML	What's Up With Jaidyn	Jaidyn is now 15 months old and can crawl on his hands and knees, sit up on his own and can pull up on furniture or our legs to stand. He cannot remain standing if he lets go, and cannot walk. He does have a baby walker (Like adults use, only cuter, with toys etc.) He loves it because he can walk behind it without falling. If you watch him from behind when he walks you can see that he walks on the sides of his feet. The physical therapy people say its because his ankles are weak. (My oldest son was born with clubfeet so my daughter thinks it is probably an inherited family issue.) His pediatrician and his Early Intervention people have never said anything about the shape of his feet, they only say his ankle muscles are weak. It seems to me that if his feet were misshapen They would have noticed before now. Having dealt with my son's clubfeet I don't see any resemblance, however I suppose it's possible. Jaidyn still can't vocalize very well and only occasionally uses consonant sounds. The PT people are having them use sign language with him. Why?

DISE	Does this sound right	I have a friend who was diagnosed with breast cancer.    Between the time she was diagnosed and had a lumpectomy the tumors had doubled in size.    She had positivee and negative nodes.    A couple of weeks later she had a port put in then soon after started chemo once every 3 weeks for a several months.    She was suppose to have a month off before she started radiation.    3 weeks after her last chemo the NP at the surgeons office diagnosed her with shingles at her surgical site so she didn't start radiation.    10 days later she started having severe headaches, nausea and vomiting.    She went to the ER and had a MRI which shold numerous brain metastases and the oncologist said that it wasn't shimgles but cancer at her original site.    She had an LP which showed cancer in her spinal fluid.    I have never heard of breast cancer spreading this fast especially while on chemo.    Can and does this happen?    Would a mastectomy have helped?    All of her original scans were normal. It has only been7 months since original diagnosis and the doctors say she has a month or less left.

SOCL	Poverty in America: Millions of families too broke for bank accounts	"http://inplainsight.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/04/22/17840373-poverty-in-america-millions-of-families-too-broke-for-bank-accounts?liteSabino Fuentes-Sanchez hid $25,000 all around his house because he didn't trust banks. Lasonia Christon receives her Wal-Mart salary on a pre-paid debit card. Kim James was homeless for most of the past decade in part because she had no place to save money.There are plenty of reasons people still live all-cash lives, but the sheer number who do it might surprise you. At a time when the majority of Americans use online banking, and some even deposit checks using their cellphone cameras, roughly eight percent of America's 115 million households donÃ¢ € ™t have a checking or savings account, according to census data compiled by the FDIC.The numbers are far higher among minorities: More than 20 percent of African-Americans and Hispanics are essentially left out of the American banking system.Frozen in the cash-only past, they face myriad Ã¢ € œkick-them-while-they-are-downÃ¢ €  situations where getting money costs money. Banks typically charge $6 to cash checks. Want to secure an apartment? Fee-based money orders are the only option. Without credit cards, they must turn to triple-digit interest rate payday loans for emergencies.span>Lasonia Christon of Jackson, Miss., tries to avoid getting paid in checks, but when her state tax refund for $231 arrived recently, she had to pay $7 to cash it at a nearby convenience store.Christon works at Wal-Mart. Her paychecks are deposited onto a prepaid debit card -- an improvement over old-fashioned paper paychecks, which led to high check-cashing fees. ItÃ¢ € ™s hardly a good substitute for direct deposit, however. One cash withdrawal per period is free, but others cost $2. She can avoid the fee by shopping at Wal-Mart and getting cash back at checkout.She is among the 60 percent of unbanked Americans who previously had a checking account. Christon used to share one with her sister, but It cost her dearly.""There was an overdraft here and an overdraft there, and it just didn't work out,"" she said.Kim James at the Dove House, a half-way house in Durham, NC that helped her get back on her feet after struggles with poverty and addiction.Fuentes-Sanchez made a fairly good living working for a tree removal company in Lumber Bridge, N.C., for about 10 years. But he was skeptical of banks, and when he tried to open an account, he was surprised by the cost.""Instead of making money, I would have to pay fees,"" he said, through a translator. ""(So) we used to keep money in the house. We were always trying to look for ways to hide the money in the house and keep it safe.""At one time, Fuentes-Sanchez had $25,000 stashed in different places throughout the house Ã¢ € “ his Latino community had been plagued by house burglaries because neighbors did the same. When his wife got cancer, her treatments devoured all their savings. Down to their last $500, and before she passed away, she convinced him to open a bank account at Latino Community Credit Union, which was opened in part to help stem the burglary problem.Ã¢ € œShe managed the money,"" and was disciplined enough to avoid spending it, said Fuentes-Sanchez, 37, who now raises five children alone. ""(I) sometimes see something and I am tempted to buy it ... Now the money is in the bank.Ã¢ € Saving -- putting money out of temptation's reach -- is the core concept of consumer banking. But the importance of participating in the financial system has stretched far beyond the quaint notion of interest, said Jennifer Tescher, CEO of the Center for Financial Services Innovation, who is generally regarded as the person responsible for popularizing the term unbanked.""A bank account in a way has become like a passport or a driver's license,"" said Tesch. ""It's a kind of access device.""James, 55, has been in and out of homelessness for several years.    She now lives at a half-way house called Dove House in Durham, N.C., and figured she could never move into her own apartment unless she could stash away the money needed for a security deposit. Without a savings account, that was a challenge.""Cash in hand is cash spent, my mother always said,"" she said.Two years ago, she met Duke University student Janet Xiao, who was part of a group named the Community Empowerment Fund, which visited Dove House offering life skills training, including a class on personal finance where she nudged women to open a bank account.    James was reluctant.""It's really demoralizing to open up an account and have it sitting in there with no money in it,"" Xiao said. Ã¢ € œI think most folks want to take one step at a time, and get a job first. Also, there is this fear of being charged fees you don't understand.Ã¢ € When James got a part-time job in January, she finally took up XiaoÃ¢ € ™s offer of help.    The two set up an account with the Self-Help Credit Union on XiaoÃ¢ € ™s laptop right at the Dove House kitchen table.""She even put the first $5 in there for me,"" James said. After depositing her first paycheck in person at Self-Help, Xiao said, James did a little dance.Ã¢ € œNow whenever I get even $10 or $20, I go to the bank and deposit it,Ã¢ €  James said. Within a few months, she put together enough to pay her security deposit and firstÃ¢ € ™s monthÃ¢ € ™s rent. As soon as she saves enough for a bed, sheÃ¢ € ™ll move in.James has been able to start banking again through the Self Help Credit Union, and has saved enough to pay a security deposit and the first month's rent for her own apartment..'Saving for the future'Self-Help is part of a growing set of financial companies called Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs). Supported by the U.S. Treasury Department, their mission is to help the unbanked get into the financial system.Ã¢ € You make sure people are getting products and services they need,Ã¢ €  said Mark Pinsky ,CEO of the Opportunity Finance Network, which helps fund CDFIs. Ã¢ € œBanks may be the best place, they may not, but we don't want to just leave them vulnerable to the predators out there.Ã¢ € Christon has recently been persuaded to open an account in a different way. Her 3-year-old twinsÃ¢ € ™ day-care facility was recently visited by representatives of the Mississippi College Savings Account program, who helped her open a small account for the children. She then realized she needed her own savings account.""I want to be a good role model for them, so they can learn about savings,"" she said.    ""I know I need to be better and show them about saving for the future."""

SOCL	18 Headless Bodies in Mexico Tourist Area	"Police found 18 mutilated, headless bodies near a lake popular with tourists and American retirees just outside Guadalajara, Mexico, a massacre that authorities blamed on the Zetas drug cartel.A phone call alerted police to two vans on a dirt road near Lake Chapala early Wednesday morning. When police opened the van, they found 18 headless and dismembered bodies inside. Some were so badly mutilated that police have still not determined their gender. The bodies appear to have been refrigerated after death.Handwritten messages were found in the van. ""They are clearly messages between rival groups that are in conflict,"" said Tomas Coronado, prosecutor for the state of Jalisco. Officials said the notes were signed by the Zetas.PHOTOS of Mexican drug cartel violence.Los Zetas have been battling the Jalisco New Generation gang, a minor cartel allied with the Sinaloa cartel, which is the Zetas chief rival for dominance of the Mexican drug trade. The Zetas cartel, which was founded by ex-members of the Mexican military, controls most of eastern Mexico and much of the north.A woman detained yesterday in connection with the separate kidnapping of 12 people in the same area told police that the abductions were connected to events in Tamaulipas state. Two dozen men and women were found decapitated or hanging from bridges in Nuevo Laredo, on the border with Texas, on Friday, where the Zetas are battling the Gulf cartel, another Sinaloa cartel ally.http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/18-headless-bodies-mexico-tourist-area/story?id=16320937"

PREG	Minocycline - how long after taking this drug before it is safe to conceive a child?	"Hello folks,Hopefully someone can kindly find an answer for me.My sister has been on 25mg Minocycline for a few months in order to treat an infection. Now she wants to have a child (1st). But she is deeply concerned about the possible side-effects of any residual Minocycline in her body.She had consulted with several doctors and the answers varied from ""no need to worry, you may try to conceive immediately after you finish with this drug"" to ""wait six months.""    I have searched Google for medical citations and have come up with nothing in regards to any related to a waiting period.Can anyone point to anything that discusses a waiting period OR not?Thank you so much!SDC"

TRMT	Possible yeast infection	Hi this isn't really about a hysterectomy... but I couldn't find a related category. I currently am having pain in my vagina. Ive had a yeast infeciton before and I don't think this is one. There is no white discahrgy stuff but it's really red and irritated. It burns to pee and it's uncomfortable. It kinda hurts and I tried having sex and it hurt.It all started after my last pack of birth contorl pills. I normally on my pill have a 3 day period. This past month I was still bleeding when I had to start my new pack of pills so I bleed for 7 days +. Anyway, I didn't think anything of it and took a minocylin pill I use for acne and ever since I've been having these issues. I am 100% positive it isn't an std. So is it still a yeast infection just without the white **** or just horribly irritated or what? Also how can I make it stop!?!
DEMO	Bleeding for 3 weeks?	My last period came 10 days late - I thought I was pregnant (nausea, very sore breasts, emotional, just 'felt' pregnant) but the tests were negative. But then I started spotting for 2 days, then I had extremely heavy (gushing) period for three days - extremely painful (my periods are often quite sore, but not that sore, and not that heavy).My period seemed to stop for a few days but then I started spotting again. The spotting gradually increased and I had some very bad pains which (at first) I thought were early ovulation pains (at this point I was at 'day 10' of my cycle). But the pains have lasted a week now - they come and go - sometimes it's like really bad period cramps (doubled over in pain) sometimes it's a tight/stabbing feeling on my left side. The spotting has now increased to being like a dripping tap. So right now, I am at 'day 18' of my cycle.Before now, my periods were very regular and always 28 days apart - would always last 5 days. I have had a copper IUD for 1 year with no problems. I would appreciate any feedback... thanks so much :-)
DEMO	Sex question	"well i was curious about this me and my bf has been together for a while and when we have sex sometimes its fine and other times it bothers me he is a ""biger"" guy. hes very gental and carnig when we make love hes not rought or anyhting ilke that but sometimes after words im so sore down there for about a day or so or sometimes just a few hours. lastnight when we were together i noticed that like inside of me to the right like on the ""wall"" or whatever ya wanna call it it was sore and felt very weird ive never felt anything like it b4. b4 that happend he had went down on me and fingured me i was wondering could he of maybe scratched me? or something? then after words i was like spotting. im just wondering what was going on? any advise u could give me id appreciate it. thanx."
GOAL	defective IOL?	"hello- I am 36 yrs old.    I had IOLs put in in 97.    I have always had small halos ever since.    Seems in the past 5 years the halo effect is geting worse in both eyes but more in the right.    When my right eye tries to focus on the sun, or a certain light, it has a ""disco-ball"" type effect around the light until my eye focuses as best it can.    If i look the other direction into the same light, the disco effect is still present, only it is ""counter-clockwise"" in the same direction of the eye. Kind of streaky.        Similar to what floaters do when you attempt to catch them in your visual field.    The amber street lights at night are horrible in the right eye.    The symptoms best described are as if I am looking through a defective peice of plastic.    Reminds me of what plastic headlights on cars do after several years.    They break down or something.    Has anyone out there ever heard of something like what I describe about    my IOL?    I have been to many doctors and eyes check out fine, IOLs look clear.    Is it possible that what I am seeing, the doctors may not be able to see with their equipment?    I'm trying my hardest to make it, and this is a big problem every day while working.    Please let me know if anyone has heard of a similar situation.    Thanks....."

Not sure if I have a medical condition and will this heal on its own.Thank youThis discussion is related toerection problems.
DISE	Results from Ultra Sound	The results are in and the DR. has ordered an Thyroid Uptake.    There is one nodule that is 2.8x1.8x1.5.    They tell me if the scan comes back normal that they will not do anything with the nodule - no meds either.    Waht are your thoughts?
DISE	PAD, Stents and travel	My dad had a procedure yesterday (dye in the arteries) to determine the degree to which his arteries are blocked.    We now know that he is getting almost no blood flow to his legs.    He has an appointment with the cardiologist in 4 days to discuss stents and or surgical options.    He would prefer to have stents over surgical options.He has a trip planned for 3 weeks from now.    The trip includes an air flight and lots of travel.My question is this.    Is it better to do the stents right away, in the hopes that he will be much more able to walk and enjoy his trip?    Perhaps he should just cancel the trip all together and do it some other time or should he go on the trip, do what little he can and then come back to have the procedures done?I would really like some outside input on this.    This is a trip my mother planned and she is feeling martyrish over the whole thing.    Personally I say cancel, why go on a trip that will be painful and exhausting?    Mother says he can wait for any procedures until after they come back.    But I see that air travel is ok about a week after stenting, and I wonder if maybe he will feel like enjoying a trip by then....

FAML	forgetfulness and zoning out in 6 year old	"My daughter just turned 6 and in the last few months we have been noticing some behavioral issues that are very concerning.    It almost seemed as though she couldn't distinguish between reality and imagination, wondering if what she thought of may have actually happened.    An example of this, she would say ""I don't know if I picked up that baby"" referring to a stranger at the store, or ""I don't know if I drank that water"" referring to the water that had gathered in a rotted out pumpkin.    Very outlandish comments, but she really wasn't sure if it had happened or not.    In the last month or so she started saying she couldn't remember things she just did, such as brushing her teeth, or wiping or finishing her meal.    She will go up to brush her teeth and I will see her brushing, but she is confused after and doesn't know if she actually did it.Her teacher hasn't noticed anything as severe as this at school, but she did say that my daughter ""zones out"" at school at least few times a week, to where she will have to pull her back in to get her focusing again.    I mentioned this to her ped. and she wants to follow up in a few weeks and suggested ordering thyroid tests or possibly a mental evaluation.    It has been very scary to watch some of these behaviors and I am hoping that it is just a phase.    Just hoping I might be able to get some advice until then, because I haven't been able to find much about this online."
FAML	Son vs Boyfriend	"Good da all,I hope and pray that this forum will assist me in solving the dilema I found myself in. I started dating my boyfriend in July this year and for the sake of my son I was not in a relationship for the past 5years after I'd broke off with his dad. My son is anti my new boyfriend which is quite sad because I am in love with this man and we are planning to get married soon. My son is 9years old and he bluntly told me that he doesnt like my boyfriend and he is not comfortable around him. I am 30 years old and my boyfriend is 41. We had a chat comparing our relationship and i tried to explain that my boyfriend intentions is not to take me away from him and nor to replace his dad but he made it clear that he hates him. There was a time when i told him that we planning to get married soon and he burst into tears and said ""I can rather stay with my dad"", he is treating me like his girlfriend because ther was a time when he said: "" daddy can have girlfriends but you not allowed to have a boyfriend"" I was completly stunned and horrified!

TRMT	Ozone therapy and Iodine	Hello everyone:I have been through a lot to chemo and radiation, I am having effects after those treatments and have two cancer issues a Cervical Cancer stage 2 the tumor is gone and now only on check ups, a Breast Cancer stage two it was clustered microcalsifications stage 2 and had a radical right side mastectomy. I am weak and fatigued I need to help my body recover from so many toxins.I was told over the Internet by two different alternative doctors in Brazil to have Ozone Therapy, to take Iodine by mouth and to drink Sodium Bicarbonate. I can't find the two doctors as they are away in a congress, I live in Peru and I am scared to trust those here.How is the Ozone Therapy done? What is the procedure? I know the method done in Spain but no more.How do I take Iodine? In liquid form? how much per take? Do I mix it with something like water? How many times?About Sodium Bicarbonate: I have been taking it as drinking water for months, two spoons of SB in four glasses of boiled cold water, is it correct?I have been checking my pH in blood with the strips, it is still very acid and not alkaline yet. How much is    reasonable    7.3/8.00?Thanks a lot for your answers.Regards.Marylou_II
GOAL	Eyes - Loss of Vision	My 15yr old daughter has been losing her sight.    Sept 11/07 was here 1st issue.    Her vision was gone for 20 minutes, both eyes, totally black.    She has since had numerous testing done.    MRI, EEG, EKG, Carotid Ultrasound, Echo Cardiogram, wore heart monitor for 2 wks, various blood tests.    After her MRI, the Pedriatric Neurologist in Nov 2007 said her test was fine & it was all stress related.    She had various periods of vision loss, 1 minute in duration, thru 2008.    March 10/09, she lost her vision for 15 minutes.     Took her to our family doctor for more testing.    The heart specialist suggested seeing a Neuro Ophthamologist, he feels the problem is from the back of the brain toward the eyes, circulation is somehow being blocked.     He explained for both eyes to lose vision at the same time, 2 blood clots would need to travel at the same time to both areas of the brain.    Highly unlikely in his opinion.    Her eyes have been tested 3x & are fine.    The question is, what type of doctor should she see.    Is the Neuro Ophthamologist the correct doctor or is there another specialist that could be suggested?
PREG	Smoking and IUI	I have been a smoker for 13 years. (horrible, I know) Anyway, I finally decided to quit since I believe that is causing me even more fertility issues than I seem to already have. My question is; Will it be beneficial for me that I quit smoking even if it was only 6 days prior to my IUI?????    I know in the long run it'll help, but will it help me through this current cycle of treatment?

TRMT	VITAMIN A : Cancer Cure or Cancer Cause? PART 2	"They don't, of course. And, if we consume enough vitamin A, perhaps neither do we. The NIH says, ""Dietary intake studies suggest an association between diets rich in beta-carotene and vitamin A and a lower risk of many types of cancer. A higher intake of green and yellow vegetables or other food sources of beta carotene and/or vitamin A may decrease the risk of lung cancer."" (9) A study of over 82,000 people showed that high intakes of vitamin A reduce the risk of stomach cancer by one-half. (10) Dr. Jennifer Brett comments that ""Vitamin A fights cancer by inhibiting the production of DNA in cancerous cells. It slows down tumor growth in established cancers and may keep leukemia cells from dividing."" (11) A derivative of the vitamin has been shown to kill CEM-C7 human T lymphoblastoid leukemia cells and P1798-C7 murine T lymphoma cells. (12)Vitamin A is very far from being a cancer ""promoter."" Rather, it is very near to the cancer solution.References:(1) Vitamin A Pushes Breast Cancer to Form Blood Vessel Cells.

FAML	3 year old holds his poop	My 3 year old son holds in his poop and has gone up to a week and a half with out going.Even when he really has to go he will clinch and get red in the face and start to cry if my wife or i ask him to go on the potty.It has gotten to the point where he will hardly eat anything when he is like this.We have given him laxitives to get him to go but the cycle continues.Why does he do this and what can we do to get him regular?

FAML	8 yr old daughter holding food in her mouth	My daughter has always been a picky although healthy eater, but she has begun holding all foods in her mouth and cheeks until it is liquified, and/or chews her food into tiny pieces before swallowing. She barely ate one of her favorite foods (sesame chicken) saying it was too crunchy or hard. We have tried ignoring it, as well as talking to her about it, but it seems to be getting worse. She is losing weight now, and was pretty slim to begin with. We thought it was sort of a game to her at first but it seems to be more of an issue that she has no desire to change now. Any ideas as to what is causing this or how to stop it?

PREG	9w3d sac but no baby	im 27yrs old 1st pregnancy, my husband n I have been TTC for a lil over 1yr now. My LMP was 9/25/11 was a week late before I took a HPT. Came out + so that same day I sched our 1st appt which I thought was going to be an U/S but it was just blood and urine test, this was done at 8 weeks.1st U/S was done yesterday at 9weeks and didn't show a baby just a sac. Doc said I must have miscarried early on and suggested a D&C. She didn't say anything else. She didnt mention what my levels were or what the sac measured or anything. She just showed us the size of what it measured with her fingers but not anything related to weeks or anything. Is this normal? Should I ask more questions before going in for the D&C? I need advice.I dont have any major pregnancy symptoms so I thought I was just lucky but after this news I figured maybe thats why but I just don't want to make a mistake. I donthave any cramping or bleeding.When I seen the U/S I personally didn't see a yolk sac (I seen other U/S pics online so I had a general idea of what things should look like in their)thanks for your help!

PREG	Confused	My husband and I have been trying to conceive since December with no luck.    My last period was April 30 and my cycles were about 27 days.    I haven't had a period since April but 4 negative pregnancy tests.    The doctors told me years ago that i had PCOS so they put me on metformin to help me get pregnant with my daughter.    I went to a specialist who told me that I don't have PCOS because I didn't have many of the symptoms that people have with PCOS.    I'm wondering since I haven't gotten pregnant yet and I'm on day 40 of my cycle right now would it be possible that I have PCOS again or that I've had it all along and the doctor was wrong when he told me I didn't have it?

I've now been off depo for over a year and my sex drive has yet to return to anywhere near where it was. Any thoughts on what I can do to get it back? Preferably without medication! Thanks!

SOCL	8 Helpful Ways To Deal With Critical People	Imagine this. You are in a good mood today. ThereÃ¢ € ™s something you are really happy about and you decide to tell your friend to share the excitement. However, your friend listens mainly in nonchalance while you are gushing away. Worse still, he/she starts giving his/her 2 cents about how itÃ¢ € ™s not really not that great. Talk about a wet blanket! Before you know it, your mood has done a 180 degree switch from happy to one of annoyance and irritation.Does this sound familiar? This is a typical behavior of critical people. Critical people can be real downers, just like energy vampires. No matter what you say, they always find some way to derail the mood of the conversation. You canÃ¢ € ™t ever remember whenÃ¢ € ™s the last time they ever gave a compliment or encouragement. They have an uncanny ability to scrutinize and zoom into every little problem there is. Following which, they fixate on these issues and offer unwanted opinions on them. If thatÃ¢ € ™s not enough, they top it off with their projection of all the possible bad things that can happen.In my article on Are You Emotionally Generous?, I shared why we should be cut out the emotional stinginess and why emotional generosity is the way to go. Critical people are emotionally stingy, because they are so bent on harping on Ã¢ € flawsÃ¢ €  and whatÃ¢ € ™s not there. They seem to have an automatic filter which mentally blocks out whatever goodness before them. Rather than give praise, they can only criticize.8 Helpful Ways To Deal With Critical PeopleNaturally, critical people arenÃ¢ € ™t the first people youÃ¢ € ™d think of hanging out with. While you can try to get out of their way, you are bound to run into one or two of them in school or at work. Here are my 8 handy ways to handle them:1. DonÃ¢ € ™t Take It PersonallyMost of the times, their criticisms reflect more about themselves than about you. They react in this manner because of certain beliefs and frameworks they have about life. You may think the critical person is all out to get you, but itÃ¢ € ™s more likely he/she reacts in this same manner toward everyone else too.HereÃ¢ € ™s one simple way to check Ã¢ € “ Think about the common friends you have with the critical person. If possible, identify people of the same standing as you, so itÃ¢ € ™s comparable. After this, try to be present the next time they are with each other and observe how the critical person interacts with him/her. How does the critical person behave? Does he/she give the same pattern of comments? Does he/she focus on the negative things? Does he/she come across as critical? Chances are high that itÃ¢ € ™s going to be a yes.Last time, I used to take a critical friendÃ¢ € ™s comments to heart. IÃ¢ € ™d wonder why she was always so discouraging, and would feel defensive when she voiced out with her unwelcomed criticism. However, when I observed her treatment of our common friends, I realized she did this with the others too. Same comments, same criticisms, same hang-ups with them, even though I never saw anything wrong with our common friends. Not only that, there was a trend in what she said and harped on. It was then I realized it wasnÃ¢ € ™t about me; it was her inner frameworks. It was a liberating realization. From there on, I no longer took anything she said personally and was able to objectify the situation.2. Understand Their Real MessageSometimes, I feel critical people are just misunderstood. They may just trying to offer an opinion but it becomes misinterpreted due to their lack of tact. At times this swirls into a big misunderstanding. They become labeled as *ssholes even though they really arenÃ¢ € ™t trying to be.Unfortunately, people become hung up over Ã¢ € œhowÃ¢ €  communication is done (the words used, the tone of communication), rather than Ã¢ € œwhatÃ¢ €  is being communicated (the message). The former ensures the message is conveyed correctly, but ultimately it is the message that matters. Critical people may be curt, but we are the ones who choose to attach the negativity to their words. Critical people may lack tact, but thatÃ¢ € ™s because they lack awareness of how their behavior implicate others. You may be surprised, but sometimes they are really just clueless on how they are coming across until they see themselves in action. If you are taking their comments negatively when they donÃ¢ € ™t intend to be negative at all, thatÃ¢ € ™s probably the worst way to expend your energy.Filter through their words (more importantly, your interpretations of their words) and get down to the real message. What are they trying to communicate? Why are they saying these? What are their intentions? Are they really trying to be *ssholes or is it a different intention? Behind their words may lie great insights. If you can get past the Ã¢ € œhowÃ¢ €  and get down to the Ã¢ € œwhatÃ¢ € œ, you gain access to valuable feedback for improvement. Two power things occur here Ã¢ € “ Firstly, you are a step ahead in your journey of conscious living because you are no longer behaving in a reactive manner. Secondly, you are literally more knowledgeable now you know the real intent of their feedback. This can be constructively used in your journey of self-improvement. Neither of these can happen if you are hung up over the criticism.The previous company I worked at is an American MNC, so the communication was often direct and to the point. There were times when people would be overly curt and blunt, especially when caught in pressing situations and tight timelines. One of the general managers was well known for his fiery temper, lashing out with verbal attacks and swearing at people when things were not going well. While some might gasp at this behavior, there is really no reason to take offense, because thatÃ¢ € ™s just how he chooses to communicate. Of course itÃ¢ € ™d be ideal if everyone communicates in a sociably tactful manner, but ultimately you canÃ¢ € ™t change how others act. You can however, change how you perceive something. What really matters is the message the person is trying to convey, more than what exactly is being said.Needless to say, the ones who chose to take comments in negative light put themselves through unnecessary unhappiness; The ones who sieved through the words and got to the essence of the message were able to improve based on the feedback. My past experience has made me more perceptive because rather than focus on exact words being said, I listen to what the person is communicating. The ability to actively Ã¢ € œlistenÃ¢ €  beyond words is critical for all of us in connecting and building strong relationships.For the rest:http://celestinechua.com/blog/2010/02/8-helpful-ways-to-deal-with-critical-people/

DISE	Disability Claim - Denied 2nd time	"Just got the mail, Social Security denied the review of my claim. I was laid off over a year ago as a computer programmer. My performance was lagging I will be the first to admit. I tried to work through the symptoms but the fatigue, body aches, and most of all the cognitive and memory skills required for my job. Social Security says ""Your physical condition does not significantly limit my daily activities.    The evidence does show that you have psychological limitations with concentration, persistance and pace. We have determined that you retain the capacity to perform your past work as a computer programmer."" I have a letter from my doctor stating my current state and that when treatment begins (in a couple of weeks) that for the next 18 months I should be on disability. I called my lawyer (who is on a 25% contingency fee) and he said that it will take nine to twelve months for a hearing. I don't know what to do? Anyone have any suggestions?"

PREG	HELP 3 month old will not sleep in crib	Hi allLet me give you a brief background. My baby would not sleep the first 3 weeks of her life. Thankfully my mother figured out that she had gas. So we fixed that problem by me not drinking any milk and releiving the gas. OK at the SAME time my mom took nighttime duty for 3 nights to give me a break (AAAAHHH) well mom had the baby sleep in her carseat. The baby slept for 6-8 hours and has ever since then.    Since then my baby will not sleep in her crib....and honestly I voted for more sleep than to fight with my baby whom I fought with for the first 3 gassy weeks of her life.    I have transitioned her to NAP in her crib during the day but her naps (honestly) stink. She is up an hour, down an hour up and hour down an hour. She has always been a bad sleeper.    Then at night we do her routine that we have been doing since week 4 (Baby is now 11 weeks old). Its bath, CD and play, feeding, put her to sleep in the car seat awake and give her the pacifier. She goes to sleep and will wake up 40 mins later crying. We go in after 5 mins to sooth her, then if she crys again we give her 6 mins    then 7 etc. It usually take us about 2 hours to get her down. OK so I was thinking that she is getting big enough to sleep in her crib since she naps in the crib. So tonight we did the routine (bed, CD and play, Feeding) and I put her in the crib awake and turned on the Peek a boo Aquarium thing I got from Target. my baby LOVES this thing. she watch it and drifted off to sleep with no issues. Well she woke up 40 mins later (just like she does in the carseat) and so I did the same routine of waiting 5 mins, 6, 7 etc before going in to sooth her. Well I got up to waiting 15 mins and the baby is crying NONSTOP. The only thing that sooths her is if I turn on the aquarium thing but she crys when that is done ( about 12 mins later).    Needless to say I asked the hubby to get the carseat out of my car. Baby is in the car seat right now sleeping like an angel.    I want to transition her now before I go back to work (on 03/16)OK SO HERE IS MY QUESTIONWhat did other moms do to transition their baby from the carseat to the crib? PLEASE dont tell me to elevate the mattress unless that worked for you. My baby naps in her crib with no problem (even if its only an hour nap..she has always been a bad napper) Is this just a phase my baby will grow out of and she will let me know when she is ready for her crib? Is there a specific technique any of you other moms have done to get her used to her crib? Someone said to buy another chaning table and put the baby in that since it kind of cradles them. Please give me DETAILS too.    When did your baby get out of the carseat? How long did it take (1 week, 1 month, 1 day etc) and MOST IMPORTANTLY    what did your baby do during this transistion (cranky, cried for 15 mins, or just fine and slept better)I feel like such a crappy mom because I feel like I cant understand my baby. I feel like she hates me because she crys at everything when I try to change her routine up.(stubborn just like daddy :)Sorry for the long post. I really want my baby to    sleep well. Her crib looks so much more comfortable than the carseat...PLUS I am worried about a flat head.

PREG	Thank you!	I just wanted to thank everyone for their posts on here. I have had two prior miscarriages one at 6wk and another at 8wk (after hearing the heartbeat). I am currently pregnant again and I am at 16wk. I have had normal ultrasounds and have heard the heartbeat which is in the 150s. I actually rented a Doppler machine and listen to the heartbeat every night. I have an Appt in two weeks (I will be 18wk) for my Anatomy Appt and I am so nervous. I am like everyone else and worry everyday about this pregnancy. Everyone tells me that I am far enough along that everything should be fine but as you know that isn't enough until I actually hold my baby in my arms. Anyways I just wanted to tell everyone thank you for their encouraging posts and I will keep everyone updated how the rest of the pregnancy goes.
FAML	6 year is a nightmare!	My grandson is 6, he's been on adderall(adderrall)and now ritalin, since he was 3.    He throws things, has temper tantrums, hits, fights, kicks, bites, wipes feces on the wall, starts fires, steals, lies, does not listen at all. He writes on the walls, jumps up and down on our vehicles, has thrown his psp so it doesnt work, torn up his playstation 2, and anything else he's ever been given.    He blames everything on his 4 yr old sister.    He has no friends at school or anywhere.    He is in first grade and makes F in behavior every day.    He still sucks his thumb.    His mom was on crack until she found out she was pregnant, which was end of 3rd month.    His parents spank him constantly.    They are always screaming and beating him for something, which he does do a lot of terrible things.    They have rewarded him for good behavior but that is very rare.    No one can stand to be around him. He won't listen to anyone and I tell his parents not to spank, they have made him this aggressive over the last four years with all these spankings, but they say that is not true, if they don't spank him, he is even worse they say.    I am so worried about him.    His 4 year old sister says she wants to die, does some bad behaviors, and beats her head against the wall any time she is told no or is in trouble. She needs help too.    Psychiatrist said my grandson has adhd, (he has been seeing one since he was 3), the school tested him and said he has severe emotional problems and mood disorder.    My granddaughter has never been seen by psychiatrist.    I don't know what to do, they tell me to stay out of it, but my heart just can't take my grandkids having so many problems.    Help me please someone!!!!!!!
PREG	Issue 2:  My son is acting out toward me, Help!	"I also have a 6 year old son Jack (and a 6 mnth old Lilly).    I have been very sick most of Jack's life.    I have a ton of medical problems, pacemakers, ports, PIC lines, home health, gastroparesis, kidney cancer, a hernia, feeding tubes.... the list goes on and on.    Once I passed the hospital with my son in the car and he said ""Look Mom, you live there!""    I just wanted to cry.Jacks father is not involved, but not by choice.    Jack's father was living with me...I got a call from my apartment complex that I had not paid my rent...come to findout he had spent all my money on crystal meth....SO... I kicked him out of my house and 4 weeks later found out I was pregnant.    I had no way of contacting him and can't find him.    So I've been    a single parent all this time.    Jack is at a age now, just started kindergarden, that he is noticing he doesn't have a dad.    I also just had Lilly, his sister, and I think he wonders about that too.    He hasn't asked me about his father, but his teachers say different.    I had a parent teacher meeting and they said he had spoken about his dad a few times, but they know I'm a single parent.    That made me so sad.    I don't know how to talk to him about this...I just had Lilly and before now I had never seen any jealousy (sp) toward her, but I think he is starting to show some.    I have to spend a lot of time with her because she is still so little and sometimes he has to wait a little while.Jack doesn't listen to me...and this is another problem.    Since I have so many medical problems I am disabled and I am sick a lot.    I lost my job and my house when I got sick, so we have had to live at home with my parents.    I love my parents and I am very thankful for them, don't get me wrong...but somethimes its made it harder on me.    My mother calls my son ""hers"".    Sometimes I feel like he is more like my brother then my son.    She takes control of everything.    Somtimes because she has had too cause I'm so sick, but others just because.    Ex.    I told Jack no cookies.    10 min later he comes around the courner with cookies saying ""I got desert, I got desert!!!"" to my face.    She gave them to him.    I can walk into the room and he stares daggers at me.    I got up this morning...didn't do anything...just got up and went to get a bottle.    My mother was in the kitchen I told her the day before that Jack didn't listen to me and that he was being ugly.    I can tell him to do something and I'll have to say ""MOM!!"" and she tells him to do whatever I just said and he does it.    Anyway I was in the kitchen and he comes in ""YOU ruined MY day yesterday!!""    I just looked at him and my mother was like ""Jack, why would you say that?""    And lastnight I was to be home alone with the kids and my sister was the last to leave.    When she walked out the door he looked at me with disgust and said ""Great! Now I'm stuck with you!"" and walked off.    She made him say sorry to me, but when I walked out of the kitchen he was in the hall glaring at me.    I lost it and started crying.    My kid hates me.    My mother is now going to put him in counciling, but for the moment we can hardly be in the same room together.    I'm the adult and I'm trying to be one, but this is very difficult.    I'm going though so much physically with my health, mentally, I'm dealing with a 6 mnth old, I'm dealing with court on Lilly and her ""father"", I found out I had cancer 4 mnths ago...so much and now this.    Ladies I don't know what to do and I desperatly need some help.    He is going to do counciling and I think I need some.    I don't want this to be going on when he is 16.    I want him to be happy and healthy, I want to have a good relationship with my son, but I feel like I'm loosing him.    My mother make it worse when she constantly calls him hers and does everything before I get the chance to try... I'm just at a loss here."
DISE	Disappearing brain lesions	"I realize that different neurologists can see different things on a brain MRI, but it's driving me crazy!I have a confirmed thoracic spine lesion.    X, my old neurologist who diagnosed me with MS, saw two brain lesions in my corpus callosum 3 years ago (where the radiologist saw nothing) and now Y, a different neurologist, says that he doesn't see them on that MRI film or the repeat that I had 2 years ago.    The one I had last year the radiologist read as normal, but Y says that I could have a T2 bright lesion in the anterior corpus callosum and a T2 dark lesion in the posterior corpus callosum, but he says that they're very subtle and could be artifact.Y seems to make a big deal that I have no Dawson's fingers or subcortical lesions.    He feels that I should have lesions if I've had MS since the 1990s or possibly longer (I had a brachial plexitis in 1984 (resolved), and had ""funky feelings"" down my left side of my body after a car accident in 1994).    Didn't have transverse myelitis until 2003.    I've had exacerbated symptoms with bronchitis and stress but also have had increased symptoms in the absence of stress or infection that I never reported to my neurologist.    So according to Y, I've had ""no episodes of focal neurological deficit in [my] life.""    Try telling that to my body when I'm tripping over non-existent things or getting nauseous within 2 seconds of looking at a computer screen (and not other things) or when I can't remember the word I want to use and have to pick something else to use (or slur my words slightly).Ok, can brain lesions disappear over time?    If I had a repeat brain MRI soon (not likely) and those possibly artifactual lesions are still there, wouldn't that indicate that they weren't artifact?What causes artifact besides movement?    I held still the entire brain MRI."

Degenerative disc disease seen at L3-4, L4-5 and L5-S1.    Degenerative narrowing, disc dehydration, and posterior circumferential annular bulging seen at each level.Note also made of right paracentral posterior disc protrusion ant L3-4 with caudal extension.    Extrusion measures about 5mm in width and depth.     It measures almost 1cm in greatest length.    It produces mass effect upon the theacal sac and proximal right L4 root in subarticular/lateral recess.Axial scans at L4-5 indicate posterior radial annular tear or fissure.    Degenerative annular bulging present.    No disc protrusion or extrusion seen.    Anterior border thecal sac is flat in the bibulging annulus.Axial scans at L5-S1 indicate broad based shallow left paracentral posterior disc protrusion.    This produces slight mass effect upon and displacement of proximal left S1 root which is not enlarged.Multilevel mild facet arthropathy identified.    No significant forminal narrowing seen.    No central canal stenosis identified.    Unremarkable conus located at T12-L1    Bone marrow signal is normal.*** Impression1. Degenerative disc disease at L3-4, L4-5, L5-S12. Right paracentral posterior disc extrusion with caudal extension at L3-4 impinging upon proximal right L4 root.3. Shallow broad based left paracentral posterior disc protrusion at L5-S1 minimally impinging upon proximal S1 root.After receiving two cortizone injections directly in the effected are, my pain is gone.    I am noticing that my right foot is sometimes not responding as quickly as it used to.    Occasionally I stumble, and might loose my footing. (very occasionally).My question is?1.Long term effect of pinched nerve roots.I know I need to see a specialist.2. Which is the better approach? Neurologist or Ortho.    I have already seen an Ortho, hence the cortizone injections.3. If I don't have pain anymore, and the pain comes back.    I cortizone just delaying the possible better results of surgery?Any resources would be greatly appreciated.This injury spawns back from an injury in my early 20's
FAML	Youngest in class	"I am having a difficult time with my 7-year old.    He is in 2nd grade and has been in 2 different schools.    The one that he attended as a kindergartner closed at the end of that year.    We chose to go to another small school similar to what he was used to.    We fought every morning for him to go into the school.    I would have to drag him kicking and crying into the school to his classroom and if I didn't sit with him for a little while, he would get extremely upset.    The teacher would literally have to pull him off of me so that I could leave.    As soon as I was gone, he was fine.    We dealt with all of that to come to a student/teacher conflict.    Being in a new school system, we weren't aware of all the ""little things"" that make school life work.    This teacher, as we found out, wasn't the best at making life in the classroom easy.    ANYWAY...2nd grade started out great and he doesn't have a problem after the first day when the teacher politely informed him that it was his job to get out of the car and come into class without his mom and that I shouldn't have to walk him in.    He would be just fine and has been.    She is a fantastic teacher.ok with all of that...here is the problem.He struggled a lot with doing homework and reading last year.    To the tune of being about 3 months behind in his reading series.    This year he has a terrible time concentrating on his work and it is still very hard to make him do his homework at night.    He is so stubborn that it is like talking to a wall.    It doesn't work to yell at him as he just shuts down when that happens.    I sit with him every night and what should only take him 15 minutes to do usually takes 30.    The teacher has talked to me about holding him back as he is the youngest in his class and at least one of the students (there are only 14 in the class) is about 15 months older than he is.    He has a horrible time staying focused.    He knows how to do the work and when he is worked with one on one...he can read to the specs of an accelerated reader.    He can do his other work when he decides that he wants to do it.    He has been tested for special education and actually did some of the tests in half the time alloted.    His results soared.The teacher has discussed her thoughts on this and when I express my concern for holding him back she says that he has the potential to be a leader and knows the stuff.    He just doesn't understand how to process all of that information in his head all the time.    She has worked many years with the 3rd grade teacher and neither of these teacher feel that he is ready to go into the 3rd grade.    The 3rd grade and the 5th grade are both the hardest grades.    Just so much transition.    He uses big words and uses them correctly.    He has great problem-solving skills.    Most of the time I figure it is stubbornness that is causing this problem, but I can't use that as an excuse for when he doesn't do his homework.I know that I am the parent and that he should be doing what I say, but when it is a daily argument to do homework, you can only fight for so long before you are ready to give up yourself.I have until the end of March to decide what I want to do.    His father won't even discuss the needs of our son.I honestly don't know what to do.    If we hold him back then we take a chance on breaking down his self-esteem and causing confidence problems.    If we don't hold him back then we are going to have study problems forever.    There are many times when I can't sit down with him at night, if I don't do it, he doesn't get it done.    Just doesn't seem to be a priority for his dad.    They don't want to fight with him as he just shuts down.I am looking for suggestions and thoughts...just need to make as accurate a decision as possible.Thanks,"
FAML	Udesending testis	My son was at the age of 9 years diagnosed with Undesending testis . This was never found at birth and Now I am curious if this causes all the behavior problems and agression he has had over the years .I am full of questions for the Uroligist when I have to take him    on Jan 24 2008.I knew when he was a toddler something was not right with him having all the agression he was exhibiting as a toddler trying to sufforcate and hurt his sister . He was later diagnosed with short term memory problems in school and on a IEP plan at school.He was diagnosed with ADHD , OCD and Optional Defiant behavior as well .     I just dont understand why this was not caught at birth(undesending testicles) and even more so with regular well check ups why the Pedatrician never found this problem.    with his testis not being in his scrotum where they belong ..I took my son to a well check up with a Pediatrican in Sebastian Florida and she checked him out and found he has undecending testicles .. a major    shock for me and his father both ..Ultrasound showed that on the left side less blood flow the cord getting tangled and on the right not as bad.When my son lived with his dad his step- mom took him to the doctor and my son was complaining of pain and he was tested for urnairy infection but when this came back negitive and our son continued to complain of pain the doctor never bothered to examine him futher downstairs to see if the pain was coming another medical problem rather than a urinary infectionI was curious if this can cause problems with the male hormones and be the root of all his agression or    he also has symtoms(symptoms)of prader willi .    He will drink soda to the point of making himself sick . He has had an obssesion with the refrigirator since he was a toddler ... his BMI is at the 95% and I could be wrong but he does have many of the symtoms(symptoms)... Not sure if he would have this with the xxy problem ?    I m not a doctor but I thought if his testicles were not were they should be he would have low hormones not high .. but could either cause all the behavior problems ..thanks
SOCL	No Feeling in my right hand	Hi All, since yesterday im unable to use my right hand completely, it feels different, it also feels heavy, what can this mean?
TRMT	desperate for help	I had a total hysterectomy in 1997 age 26 after having severe lower right abdominal pain from ovarian cysts and endometriosis. I was more or less told i would be skipping through the daisies with joy afterwards. Reality was it was the worst mistake i ever made. After surgery 2 idiotic nurses tore the dressing off my wound. It should have been soaked off in a bath of warm water. The result was that on my right side the incision was pulled open and during the week i was in hospital the wound was left gaping open. On leaving hospital i arranged a home nurse to come in and she was horrified. She said it needed packing and would never heal if left open. She had to pack it twice a week for nearly a month. HRT was stopped when the patches gave me a rash and my dr would not change it. Over the years my weight shot up, i had severe hip and buttock pain, sciatica, lower back pain and aching joints and palpitations and feelings of lightheadedness and weird spaced out feelings. 5 years ago i lost a lot of weight to try and cure my back pain but it got worse. Then one day i collapsed with excruciating lower right pain but at the hospital it suddenly stopped like flicking a switch. I was told it was probably gas. The pain did not come back for 5 months and back in hospital again i was told it was prob adhesions and i should get a hobby and learn to live with it. For the past year the pain had died away but a couple of days ago it was back with a vengeance. On top of that i have a weird feeling in my stomach like period pains as well as this right sided pain and a feeling of fullness in my bowel which is relieved for a short time by going to the bathroom usually 4-5 times a day. This is the longest the pain has lasted and i just want to know what is wrong with me and be believed.
FAML	Everyone Please Read This!	"Guys, the 12 year old girl who was trolling around the Child Behavior Forum is back. She has been mainly posting in the Maternal/Child Forum. She makes up stories to get people's sympathy and when she gets found out, she disappears for awhile only to show up again under a different username. So far we know she's used at least 4 different usernames. They are""dogluver123212RKBKmommyof10and the latest is #5onthewayYou might recognize that she wrote a post here about her 12 year old needing glasses. She's the 12 year old! She also made up a big story on the Maternal Forum about her 23 year old son falling downstairs and becoming paralized. She had us going for a day or two but her story kept getting more bizarre. You can read it at the Maternal Forum titled ""Prayers Needed"".I'm just letting everyone know because she keeps coming back using a different username. I want everyone to be aware and watchful. She's actually given out dangerous advice. Laura1977 warned everyone about her too back on page 5 on this forum.I actually feel kinda sorry for this kid. She keeps mentioning her brother's death. Maybe something really did happen and she doesn't know how to deal with it. I don't know. Like I wrote to the others on the maternal forum, I just wish she didn't feel the need to make up stories. If she's needing someone to talk to, she could always go to the depression or teen forum or something. It's sad because her actions are just making things worse for her.Who knows, though, maybe this time she'll leave knowing we all are watching for her.Anyway, I just wanted to let you all know so we can be watchful and aware.Take care, everyone."
GOAL	Switching from HCG Injections to Oral?	I have been on the HCG (Injections) diet since the first of June... HOWEVER, I did great for the first two weeks, lost 12 pounds... then bombed.    I stopped for a few days, then started taking again... then stopped, started.... not consistent and have gained my weight back.I have 6 more injections left at home.... this would have been a total of 35 shots as I didn't go back to the doctor to get the remaining 5 (to total 40) injections.I have not taken the shots in over two weeks.    Can I start over and take the oral version?    Do I need to wait - which I dont' want to as that initial weight loss was a great feeling?    How long can I take this?Also, where can I purchase this oral version online... somewhere safe that I will not get counterfeit drops?
DISE	Itchy Arms	"I have had ""itchy arm syndrom(syndrome)"" for 2 years now.    I had it last Fall on my right arm and it has started again this summer only on my left arm!    Last year it seemed to go away all by itself after using creams and ointments for weeks to no avail.    I remember one night waking up in the wee hours with my right arm itching so bad I stood in the middle of the room gouging at it with my nails and stamping my feet it itched so badly!    I was living on antihistimines!    They helped, but I hate the way they make me feel!For several years I had been aware of a sensitivity to fabric softeners and some detergents - before the itchy arm started I had been suffering from a sore on the inside of my right cheek and sometimes on the tip of my tongue.    The intensity would rise and fall, but they never went away.    My mouth was often so sore I didn't want to talk or eat.    Brushing my teeth was very painful.    It was definitely interfering with my life.    I had biopsies done fearing oral cancer.    Thank God, they were negative.    I finally figured out it was both the fabric softener and the detergent I had been using.    I discontinued the fabric softener and switched to Arm & Hammer dye and perfume free detergent - the sores went away!    Every so often a garment I had not rewashed would surface and I would immedately feel the sore spots, but a change of clothes would solve the problem!When the itchy arm started, I eliminated the detergent angle because of my previous experience and the fact that I had already switched to the less irritating product.    So last year I suffered greatly until it spontaneously stopped.    This year when it started again,    after several weeks of suffering, I found the common thread!    Each year in late summer or early fall when our natural spring water supply is low and we are conserving water, I set my clothes washer to a setting which eliminates an ""extra"" rinse!    This year, after doing so, my itchy arm came back - so I turned the extra rinse back on and when I wear the clothes I have rewashed, my arm doesn't itch - when I put on something I haven't rewashed, it itches like crazy!    MYSTERY SOLVED!For all you folks with itching arms, one or both, try eliminating fabric softener, and go to perfume and dye free detergents.    Use the minimum amount of detergent to clean your clothes, and make sure it is thoroughly rinsed out - add an extra rinse to your washing cycle if necessary!    It has taken me a few years, but I have discovered this solves my ""itchy arm syndrom(syndrome)""!    Can't hurt to try it, but give it a fair test.    If you don't want to rewash everything you own immediately, wash enough complete sets of clothes to last a few days.    Start the experiment with a shower ( I use all dye and perfume free soaps now), then put on your chemical free clothes and see if the itch doesn't dissipate immediately!I don't understand why, but my experience tells me that It doesn't matter what part of your body comes in contact with the chemical that one is sensitive to, the allergy manifests itself    elsewhere.    My first experience with this was many years ago - my left breast was itching all the time.    I looked in my bra for some foreign object - nothing.    I washed and washed them thinking I might have an allergy to the soap that they had been washing in - nothing.    Finally, I discovered the culprit - I was showering with Dial soap - I quite using Dial soap, changing to a soap for sensitive skin, and the itch stopped!    If I go back to Dial - the itch on my left breast starts again!If you want your dermatologist to think you are crazy, run that one by them!This discussion is related toItchy Arms."

DEMO	Low Abdominal pain by pelvic line... diagnosed after 3 years.	I am about at my wits end.    For three years now I have had chronic lower abdominal pain.    I have been to so many Dr's and ER's....still no answers.    This started in 08 after I had my son, and also had surgeries for cervical cancer and to remove my gull bladder.    No one has been able to tell me anything.    At first they would come on once every few months....now I am having them weekly...and I am also having blood in my urine.    There is no warning signs to my pain...it just hits me out of    no where.    It is in my low abdominal, right above my pelvic line.    It radiates sometimes into my back....and hurts all over in the lower abdominal, but sometimes is isolated to the right side from time to time.    When it hits,. it hits hard and I can't even stand up straight.    I get sick to my stomach and it feels like someone is ripping my insides out.    I have had Drs laugh at me, I have had them tell it is was all in my head.    At this point, I am so ready to give up and just accept the fact that I will never have an answer or be better.    The pain meds they give me really do nothing for the pain, only make me want to sleep.    I do get a slight relief if I lay on the bed perfectly still and do not move.    The pain is still there, but lessons a tad, of course until I move again.    The full blown pain can last any where from as short as 3 hours to a full 24.    But then once the massive pain is over I am tender and soar for days to follow.    I am so needing answers....if anyone can relate, please advise!    Thanks for your time.

TRMT	Stented	I am scheduled to have a TAH BSO in approx 4 weeks and was told that due to the degree of anatomical shift related to the size of the uterus and cystic ovaries ureteral stents will be used to demarcate the bladder structures to help prevent unintended damage. Has anyone experienced this and how will it add to the post op period? Very much intolerant of pain and nausea. Have previously had 2 C-sects and can relate to the post op period, but the stenting adds a new dimension. If there is anyone who has had this coupled with the TAH? When were your stents placed? Have also had epigastric pain after eating meals. Have been told that the pain is from the food passage being compromised and creating a reflux picture, all due to uterine size. Has anyone experienced this? Any suggestions? Again do not like pain and nausea.
PREG	Am I fooling myself?	So my dh and I have been ttc for a few months now. We had a mc last November and really hope to be pregnant soon :) My last af was on April 26th so I am due in about a week. Lately I have had symptoms of: sore breasts especially nipples (and I never get sore boobs, not even with my miss last year), been feeling a little nauseous at night and sometimes the morning, gotten dizzy a few times, tires all the time and almost can't get up in thE morning!, and I've had sever acne over my back shoulders chest breasts and face and I hardly get acne. I was just diagnosed with hypothyroidism and was told that may have led to my miss last year. I recently started medication for that and also been given vitamin d and vitamin b because I am deficient in both. I can't help but get my hopes up because of my symptoms but I'm also worried that I'm just fooling myself. Has anyone else experienced similar symptoms to find out they were indeed pregnant? And anyone else with hypothyroidism vitamin b and d deficiency find out you were pregnant? What were your symptoms??
FAML	toddler tremors	Occasionally, my 15 month old son has hand tremors, which concern me.    The hand shaking is usually right after a nap, where he is still a little sleepy.

I have touched his hand to stop them and when I release his hand they continue.    This is not a daily occurrence.    Is this something to be worried about?

DISE	stinging pain in breast	I have had a stingy burning like pain under the nipple around the areola for quite some time. This week I developed a very sharp stinging pain that feels deep inside the left breast. I examined and found that there is a bruising type of sign under the nipple and an indentation. The stinging is very localized and very painful. My left breast is much larger than the right, always has been and when I am sitting at a table, the breast pushing against it, I can feel a aching there. There is    a pimple like mole that has developed also. Any ideas?
DISE	clear cell & right chemo drugs	I'm 35, will get married but unfortunately, by surgery 3 weeks ago, i had my both ovaries, tube, uterus & omentum removed since a cyst on my ovary was malignant. so having baby is impossible. I'm diagnozed ova ca stage 1c with clear cell adenocarcinoma. my doctor will get me 3 cycles chemo by platinum based drug. i heard that clear cell is resistant to platinum based chemo drug (carbo,cisplatin, cyclophospomide, doxorubicin, 5FU, paclitaxel,taxol, etc) & platinum based causes recurrence. And some platinum would increase CA-125. I also heard that Irinotecan plus mitomycin C is more effective to kill clear cancer cell. I'm blind about this cause in my country, doctor usually is not open to give more information. Anyone know about this issue? And how to avoid recurrence? How I increase my red & white blood cell before chemo? Thanks all, God bless u

SOCL	Anonymous Warns Karl Rove Not To Do It	"MADISON, WISCONSIN.    Does anyone remember the historic 2006 elections where Americans finally sent a slate of legislators to Washington to put the brakes on the radical extremist policies and war-machine of George W. Bush (and remember, W stood for Herbert WALKER -- this does matter).    Just before that historic election, Karl Rove told NPR that, despite polling data to the contrary, he had ""the math"" and that no meaningful change would happen.    What was he actually stating?Last week, a video showed up on YouTube -- a shot across the bow to highly-placed political insiders:    Anonymous warns Karl Rove not to do it this time (h/t Mark Crispin Miller).    After the jump, we will share this short video (1 min 37 sec).VOICES has inside information, direct from the source, that a ""statistically significant and definitive"" report will be released this week that will clearly demonstrate how ""official"" election results are not legitimate.    We have been told directly that the report is being released in the hope that, by identifying how honest and accurate vote counts are undermined -- Karl Rove (and others) will have to ditch a plan to steal the November 2012 elections.It appears the hacktivist group Anonymous is also working to send Rove and company the same message:Anonymous is watching and will not stand down if Karl Rove and his Crossroads PAC overthrow our government by stealing the 2012 election.     Rove has taken steps to ensure that Americans believe this election is a close race -- too close to call.This provides cover to step in and rig the numbers to elect Mitt Romney and proclaim that, because it was a tight race, Rove's candidate was able to squeak through a close election.If Rove believes this -- he is making a mistake.    Anonymous is watching closely and collecting highly technical data which, should the fix be in, be turned over to authorities in the hopes that Rove will be prosecuted to the full-extent of the law.Highly qualified and talented techies are monitoring key servers and Internet traffic on each of theses servers for anything suspicious -- Rove will not get away with any fraud without appropriate consequences.It will be best for Karl Rove, any co-conspirators, and America, for them not to even try to tamper with honest election results.http://voicesnewspaper.blogspot.com/2012/10/anonymous-warns-karl-rove-not-to-do-it.html to view the video"

GOAL	Numbness in tongue	I had to have a root canal December 4, 2007 for a tooth which had a very large filling in it.    After the dentist gave me an injection of novacaine, I have no feeling in the tip of my tongue and along the right side of my tongue.    I am afraid I will never regain the sensation in my tongue again.    Can you tell me if this is normal, and if so, how long it will take for the feeling to return?

DEMO	Sore, tender clitoris? Anybody else had this problem?	Hi everyone I'm new here and I'm a bit worried!Basically last month I began to feel sore down there. I checked myself out and found a small cyst on my clitoris. I went the doctors and they drained it for me and gave me antibiotics which cleared it right up.Now, a month on I have begun to feel sore again :( The pain began early this morning, again on my clitoris. I checked where the pain was but couldn't see a cyst. I got myself over the doctors today and the nurse said there's nothing there but it is very red and sore. She's given me antibiotics again so I'm going to have to see how I go and hope to god I don't find a cyst there tomorrow.I should add that both times this has flared up, I've been due on my period. I'm not sexually active so it can't be that.I had a Bartholin's cyst, or an abscess earlier this year which I had to go to hospital for. I wonder if that has been the trigger for all this, although that was a lot more painful.I was just wondering if anybody has experienced the same and if anybody knows the cause and how to prevent it in future?! I can't be putting up with this every month and I have a new job to start on monday :(My doctor said he's going to refer me to a gynaecologist next week.Anybody else had this problem?

My allergist said it was something called ""vesticularitis"" dont know if that is spelled right or not.    He gave me prednisone to take for about 2 weeks and said they would go away.    I'm off the medication now and they are still there.    They are only on my shins, and not anywhere above my knees.    I talked to my primary care doc and they said they didn't know what to tell me.This is really scaring me because I don't know what this is.    My allergist told me if they didn't go away or if they came back then I might have some sort of disease.    My follow up appt with my allergist isn't until July.These hives don't itch, burn, or have any side affects.    They are just there.    After taking prednisone they became less red, now they are darker.    I have never had anything like this before.I want these to go away because they make my legs look horrible.Can ANYONE give me an answer to what is wrong?This discussion is related toAnkle and Leg - Red, slightly swollen, Hives running up leg."

DISE	new here and need some advice	Hi Im new here. My name is Jenny and im 31 yrs old. I have 3 children and a wonderful fiance whom i have been with for almost 3 yrs now. My mom went to the dr. about a wk ago with fluid build up in her abdomen and left lung well they sent her to the hospital and last wk monday found out that shes got stage 4 ovarian cancer. She had the surgery to remove most of the tumor this last saturday and is still in the icu unit at the hospital. She still has tumor in her lung and in her bowels. She will have to go throu chemo for about the next 6 months. She is 68 yrs old. I am kinda of scared now because i know that my risk doubles now. I have read that when a woman who has had a tubal ligation has a low risk of getting it which i had one after i delivered my 3rd child. Now im just curious as to where my risk level is now. I mean it was low because of me having a tubal but now with my mom having it does it double or am i in the middle or what? Im so confused. I have also been experiencing spotting in between my periods. I think stress brings it on because it only lasts like a day and then its gone for a couple then comes back and so on . I have had this for the past 2 months or so. I have an appointment with my gynocologist in March for my annual pap and pelvic. Any advice would help alot. Ive experienced spotting between periods before but only once in a great while and it only lasts like 2 days after my period ends but never where it keeps coming and going from the time it ends till it starts again. no abdomenal(abdominal)pain or anything with the spotting.

FAML	need help dealing with good and bad behavior	My wife and I have been raising out 4 yr old grand daughter since Sept 2008. She was 2 yrs old at the time. In april 2009 she was dianosed with ostrea Sarcome(Bone Cancer). We were devestated, and we were really torn with deseasons that we were having to make almost immediately. She treatement plan was to go through Chemo for 34 weeks, and have her left leg amputated in 10 weeks. My wife kept working throught all of this and I was the care taker who would spend 5 - 6 days and nights at the hospital. My wife would come at the evenings and spend the weekend threre. During all of this, I was taught to do things that the nurses were trained to do. Things that were paingful to our grand daughter. But I did them reguardless, because it was the right thing to do. Our granddaughter hated me for this. Verballly and physically. Most of the time she would tell me to leave and that I was mean. Over time it really got to me that I just wasnted to quite. But I love her and could not stop. We have been home now since January. She still continues to see me as the bad guy. Most other times she loves me and loves to play with me. Still I want to run and give up. The real problems is that my wife is the opposite. She allows her to do things that I say no too. This makes our grand daughter see me as what he says doesn't matter. Grandma will give me that. I'm mad at both Grandma and granddaughter. I've read that younger children will do things because they don't understand. That we are supposted to respond with a positive answer, and explain to them why we are doing it. But the hurt and angry that she throws at me really hurts. I feel like I've stopped my life to take care of her and she owes me. That really sounds bad, But that's how I feel. Don't get me wrong, I would do it all over again if I had to. I love her to pieces and if God or whoever could give me her issues, I would take them in a minute. she is too young to have to go through what she is going through.I'm very tired. We spend 5 days a week driving 30 minutes each way to doctors appt. Usually 1 to 2 hours at the appointment. Then 30 min back. Not to include getting her dressed and breakfest. Then I take her to school, Then I go to work and work 8 hours. There is not enough hours in a day, and not enought days in a week. I'm very tired.I'm just complaining. Looking for someone out there with simular issues, and maybe some suggestions on how I can handle life alittle betterThanks for listening.
PREG	Can you be pregnant if you have two cycles in one month	I didn't have a cycle in february and i had two in march, but i didn't have one in April. It's the beginning of may and i still haven't had a cycle yet. I keep loosing and gaining weight. I'm always hot and have to sit in the front of the fan, sometimes i feel like i want to vomit or throw up. I can only lay a certain way in the bed to get comfortable and i'm having mood swings. This isn't like my body. I currently have a mirena implanted in me. So does this really mean that i am pregnant. I am really confused.
FAML	Looking for an outlet	I am probably going to cause a lot of sparks with my post, just trying to get a better idea of my options.Okay, I'm 22 years old living at home because of college and my father is an alcoholic. I never thought he was until after I graduated high school went to basic training and then came home to find my dad had really changed. We use to go to friends and drinks and that was always fun, never had a problem. Over the last four years he has really gone downhill, he makes no sense, comes home drunk and finds anything and everything to complain about and is even getting forgetful, not to mention he's always complaining of some type of stomach problem and he looks pregnant (famous beer belly). The thing is he is in strong denial and has adapted a morning dependecy not just beer like bloody mary's and JD. There is no talking to    him anymore. My father and I use to be really close and after he came home drunk and criticized everything about me and acts like the world is out to get him I just can't hold a conversation with him anymore and it's really hurtful. If i try to talk to him about it sober or not he turns it around to saying I really hurt his feelings. It's been like that for almost 2years now.The situation has yet worsend. My mother is completely against drinking and of course my father hides it, until he come home and can't hide it and then it usually turns into a big blow out. Well, back in November I was pulled over and had been drinking, yes of course I was arrested for a dui. I wasn't drunk but had enough in me, ( I was pulled over for not having my lights on, something I always do) I was out and just wanted to go home and go to bed, I should've just waited another half an hour and I woudn't be in the situation I am now. Not point into going into that I made a bad choice and I have accepted the consequences.I thought my mom was going to freak out on me, she didn't. She has of course said you've done this to yourself....but I know you dont have a problem and don't drink that much unlike your father, you'll get through this just fine. Coming from my mom this really shocked me. I have found out that she was hoping my situation would help my father realize how easy it is even when you are attempting to me (somewhat) responsible and careful. It has not and instead my fathers drinking of course has only gotten worse. After he picked me up, I asked him if he was disappointed,    I was told no, things happen. WHAT!?! I mean granted anything anyone can say to me can not amount to the disappointment I have in myself but still, aren't parents supose to say something?I am not sure what my real issue is with all of this. I have been court order to go through a few classes and be on probation. ( I have no counseling and am not interested in seeking any for personal reasons) The classes really opened my eyes and the whole time the only thing I could think of was my dad and how his alcoholism has affected us. He told my mom that he knows who started me drinking, I never drank regularly until I started drinking with him ( she does not know this, and I want to save her the pain of that) After it first happened he was all about helping me out and everything, I stuck to it that I did this to myself and will make it through it on my own. I of course lossed my license for a time period and that has been the only time I have gone to anyone for help, transportation to work and classes. My dad has gone to my mom saying I've asked him for money and how he refused to give it to me, this never happened and never will.I know I'm at risk for alcoholism because of my father and have always known that and everything that has happened up to this point has really enforced my want to not turn out like that. I am disguisted with myself and yes I do kind of blame him alittle bit and know he feels guilty but I find I am more disguisted in him. Sometimes I wish probation would come and check on me when his in one of his drunken rants so he could be right where I am and maybe some type of intervention would be to save his health and his family.My mother and I talk more now about his situation and the affects of it. As much as my dad thinks that I am dependt on my parents my mom sees that I am not that and that I working really hard. I graduated college in June, have been working the same job for almost 3years, am starting to look for another part job and as it is looking I will be released from being monitored by the court system early. Stuff is really going to get deep after I graduate in June and when the cold hard fact of me moving becomes a reality whether it be earlier then planned or in the fall. I feel that the only way to break away from all of this is to walk away and never look back, I really do not want to do that but I can't see it any other way. Suggestion, advice and opinions or any similiar situations?

SOCL	Sexuality confusion	I want to know how can help your child if they fell confused with there sexuaity? today high schools and children seem to invite and even promote homosexuality.The friends of my child our either Bi or gay.This seems to be like fade and in the cross fire i feel that is why my child has talked with me and told me about the confusion.I myself can remember that my Father did not want me as to be around boys.I was always around my girl friends and i also admitted to my parents at 13 that i thought i was a lesbian.I know now that i was still finding out who i was and there was no rush to give myself an idenitity in any aspect of my life.i have nothing against homosexuals.I just feel that with all the shine and boasting that this friends do it seems to be a feeling of kinship for my child than in actual sexual preference .I than wonder if my own life may have in some psychological way made my child feel this way.I have been divorced for almost 8 year I was married very young and was married for 17 years .I have had only one serious relationship since and that ended 4 yrs ago.I do not find the need (as a lot of single women do) to run out and find a man .I feel if it happens it happens.My children come first.
SOCL	Honesty	My husband comes to me two nights ago and tells me he got a friend request on Fb from some woman from his home town. She looks much older then him in her pic he said but may be an ex from high school. I look at pic with him say I think she is about his age ( he looks younger)    Said it can't be ex b/c different last name DUH she is married it said her maiden name too. Now, I commend him for being so honest with me. And things are going great with us. IT is just that I thought things were going great before two. You see he seems to get caught up in the attention of other people. I realize it stems from insecurity from childhood being abandoned and all but he said he is no way insecure in our relationship now. The thing is it is eating at me. I guess this is the true test of his honesty. But I hate feeling this way.

FAML	9 year old boy - anger and disrespect in school	please can you help.    my nine year old boy, I would say is a typical boy except in school.    He has always been full on in school, has disrupted his class, but this seems to have stopped and academically he is clever, no problems with his work.    He is a very young 9 year old, some of his class are nearly a year older than him.    But the problem is playtime, he doesn't stop to think.    The problem at the moment is there is a boy in his class they say has anger problems and can't help it.    When he hits my son, or calls him names we and the school have told our son to walk away and tell the teachers.    He seems to deal with it himself, doesn't tell the teachers all the time, sometimes when he tells them the reaction is negative.    But he goes over the top.    Example today some of his friends really upset him going into his face saying he was rubbish at football, the boy with anger problems did the same and when my son turned away he hit my son in the back, not hard so my son turned round and kicked him hard, when the dinner lady told him to stand by the wall he said no, then another dinner lady tried, he told her no and went and sat down by the railings.    His teacher had to come and get him and told him he had let her down, himself and me.    He said he felt very angry.    He doesn't seem to get walk away.    Once he grabbed one of the pupils by the neck because my son thought he was hacked at football when he wasn't, the boy concerned was so upset.    Outside of school my son is typical, but excellent manners and people say a credit to me.    Please help as I do not know what to do.    The teachers say to my son you know ...... has anger problems and you know better.    So is it right that my son has to put up with being taunted and hit by this boy because he can't help it.    My son is no angel but he has to stop his anger and being disrespectful to adults.

GOAL	EYES Pain	i have momentary loss of vision on my left eyes and consistent sharp intense pain for both eyes. When i went to c specialist, he say is due to dry eyes syndrome and the reason for the loss of vision is unknown. Now my dried eyes is becoming better already, the pain of the eyes is now more severe, where it is no more intense sharp pain but long persistent pain, which up to hours. My right eye's pain occurs in the morning when i wake up but the left eye's usually occurs after the right eyes and the left eye very easy to feel tired, especially when it is about evening and night time. The left eye is watery compared to the right one and when press against it, it feel more soft compared to the right one. I feel my left eyes start to deviate from the normal condition that my eyes usually have. My left eye feels tired easily that sometimes i need to close it and use only my right eye. What happen to both my eyes?
FAML	Anger problems	"I have a 9 year old almost 10 who experiences sudden outbursts of anger like a volcano.    He runs from authorities when they request they go with them, but this anger seems to dissipate anywhere from 5-15 minutes after the episode.    Most of the time this behavior is seen at school.    He has been suspended several times from 4th grade because of it.    He will just suddenly blow up at another student for something that he didn't like and will sometimes lash out at them.    It's never the same thing that sets him off.    He has also threatened other students with words and is recently starting to display signs of wanting ""revenge"" on every one.I just had another meeting with the school principal, vice principal, social worker, behavior coordinator and teacher.    He was diagnosed with ADHD and ODD when he was younger, 5 I think.    I feel that he was misdiagnosed and the school social worker agrees with me.    I am a single mom and have been for 8 years, I am not working and am afraid that once I get a job I will lose it because the school continuously calls me to come get him.    I requested that and IEP be done, which they agreed to.    I have had him on the Concerta for his ADHD and it made his volcanic mood swings more extreme.    He has been off of them for 2 years and is currently taking Evening Primrose Oil 1000mg once a day...it seems to help a little but I am at my wits end and don't know exactly who to turn to for help.Which is the best type of professional to take him to, so that he can be reassessed to find out what is really happening? I'd like to stick to natural alternatives, not synthetic drugs.    And, Are there any real successful anger management for children programs available?"

GOAL	Starbursts after YAG (Crystalens IOL's)	"I have extreme starbursts around headlights, traffic lights, candles, even Christmas lights especially at night, but even somewhat in the daytime.The stars are the color of the light, except if it's a white light -- then they are rainbow. My surgeon says I'll get used to it and ""they must be pretty.""It's not only irritating, but quite dangerous. I can hardly see to drive at night. I'm 48 years old and drive every night.I didn't have cataracts, but high myopia, so I never should have got the Crystalenses in the first place. (They don't seem to ""accommodate"" much, if at all, anyway.) The claims that these lenses will give you the full range of vision are false, as far as I'm concerned. I should have just kept wearing contact lenses. At least I used to be able to see at night with the contacts.Is there any hope to get rid of the stars??"
SOCL	Alligator wanders into Florida middle school	"STORY HIGHLIGHTSAlligator was trapped inside school by wildlife expertsStuart Middle School is near the Hillsborough RiverIt's currently gator mating season(CNN) -- Looking for love, or perhaps just for some cafeteria food or spelling lessons, an alligator was found Monday inside a middle school in suburban Tampa, Florida.Tampa police were notified around 7 a.m. that the gator had set itself down in a prime spot, ""in front of the cafeteria in Stuart Middle School,"" the department said in a written statement.Although school does not let out for another week, no children were inside the school when the reptile was discovered, said Hillsborough County School District spokesman Steve Hegarty.The school is near the Hillsborough River, so it's not too far-fetched to think an alligator might make its way inside, Hegarty said. Still, he doesn't recall any similar incidents.""The gator was contained in one of the hallways,"" police said. Trappers from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission caught the creature. No one was injured.It's currently alligator mating season. According to the conservation commission's website, alligator ""courtship"" begins in early April, with mating occurring in May or June."

DISE	Alternatives to Thyroid Removal?	I was diagnosed with a benign thyroid nodule that is either 2.8 or 3.8 in size. It is ovular. Originally the doctor had said that it was 2.8 but today rechecked the test results and said 3.8. With 2.8 and benign, it doesn't need removal. If 3.8, it's strongly recommended. My blood test results were normal. Aside from finding out what the reading is, because the doctor won't admit he said 2.8 originally and it hasn't grown in a week (he said today that it hadn't and the numbers are the same. Still suspicious why he kept saying 2.8 the last time. Not just once and had the test results themselves in front of him), I'm wonding if I should just go ahead with the sugery. Or if there are alternatives to zap the nodule so its no longer an issue. I'm 32 years old, female, and in relatively good health. There is no family history of this and I'm confused and worried.
FAML	Baby bit another child	"Yesterday at daycare, my 17 month old bit another child.    Didn't draw blood thank goodness, but it was hard enough to leave a mark.    I am continuing with the time outs when he bites or hits, but they are not allowed to use time outs at the daycare, so there is inconsistency.    Obviously putting him in time out at home for something he had done much earlier in the day serves no purpose...he wouldn't understand why it was happening.    All they are allowed to use at his daycare is diversion (believe it or not it is the law here..sigh).    I apologized to the other child's parents...I just felt so bad.    They were super nice and said it happens...in fact it seems they are dealing with the same situation with their child.    When he bites or hits it is not aggressive.    He isn't angry or frustrated the majority of the time.    It's like he is playing.    It's concerning because I don't want to see that kind of behaviour and I understand how important it is to end it now.    It's not as frequently as it was, so what we are doing at home is working....at home.    But at daycare there is no real consequence so I guess he thinks it's ok there.    Any suggestions for me?    He is still a bit young to reason with obviously, although we do consistently tell him ""no biting"" or ""no hitting"".    Thoughts?    Thanks so much."

FAML	10 year old fit	"My son is a very bright student and happy young man.    Two and a half years ago we had a daughter, up until that point he was an only child.    Over the past year, he has been having    very dramatic, scary    fits.    Crying, screaming, recently hitting over various things.    I can't rememeber what set off the very first one, but I do remember the second one was last summer when I was returning home from my families house far away.    He wanted to stay, which at one time was the plan, but due to some misbehaving on his part and because my sister is not to much into observing her own children closely, we changed our minds.    When it was time to leave, he started crying and throwing a fit.    Once on the road home, he spent two hours yelling, screaming, crying and kicking the back of my chair.    All this with his baby sister in the back seat.    He threatened to jump out of the car, but never did. His Dad tried talking to him, but he could not calm him down.    Finally, I got his Nana on the phone and she calmed him down.    The rest of the drive home went well.    It was like some switch went off and he was back to himself.Several months went by without any outburst, but then here it came again.    I had bought him a book he had wanted when I went to the bookstore and got his sister a book too.    When he got home and saw his sister had a book, he began to ask questions.    I told him I got him a book as well, but I would let him have it as soon as he finished the one he was reading.    The next night he finished his book and wanted to get his new one.    When he received it, a look of disappointment came across his face.    He put the book down and started to pout.    ""What was that"", I said, with my hand to my ear like I was waiting for a thank you.    Instead he just pouted.    I told him I would take the book back, just to give it to me.    He handed me the book and asked if he could pick the new one.    I told him that he would not be getting a new book, that he was acting ungrateful and he should be happy with what he got.    From there the fit took off, screaming and yelling he demanded his book back, it wasn't fair his sister got to pick her book.    When my husband tried to get him to go to his room, he wouldn't move.    The whole thing turned into a big mess.    He ended up hitting and biting my husband.    Yelling and crying demanding his book back.    We called his Nana over, which he typically would not act like that in front of her, but didn't seem to care.    The rest of the fit involved him running down the street, threatening to jump out his windows...When it was over, it was over.    Like nothing ever happened.Bewteen then and now, there have been a few fits, but my husband has gotten pretty good about talking him down.Last night however, it was on again.    We have been talking for months about moving him to the downstairs bedroom so that his sister could be close to us. Up until this time, she has been in our bedroom.    At first he would not hear anything about moving, but finally he acted as if he did not mind.    Last week I mentioned picking a paint color, and when we went to the hardware store, he was the one who brought up picking a color.    This past weeked I painted the downstairs room and moved his things into the room. All Sunday long he talked about how he loved it, read his books in there, showed it off to everyone who came by to see it, but then it was bedtime.    I had no sooner tucked him in and here he came.    He wanted his new room back, he was not staying there, he was use to where he was and did not want to move.    The fit was on...crying, screaming, arms flailing, stratching himself, stiffing up, screaming and screaming.    After a spanking, that did no good, it only made him madder, and lots of talking to, he finally settled down and went to sleep.     But sometime during the night, he was at my bedside crying about how he wanted his room back.    My husband ended up sleeping in the living room downstairs and my son spent the rest of the night in his new room.    Of coarse this morning the first words out of his mouth were, ""I want my room back"".    One other note, his teachers have always loved him.    They always talk about what a wonderful student he is and how helpful and sweet his is.    He has never thrown a fit of any sort that I know of in school.    However, on Friday this past week,    I was sitting with my son and daughter reading books and talking.    All of a sudden, I notice a bite make on his forearm.    I asked him who bit him and he said no one.    I told him it was clearly a bite mark and I wanted to know who bit him.    He stated he couldn't remember over and over.    I finally told him that he had to remember who bit him, and he finally said he did it himself.    He stated that he had to retake a math test, that he thought he had failed the first one.    I asked if anyone saw him do it.    At first, he said no one saw him and then he finally admitted that not only did his teacher see it, but she had to take him out the room and ask him to calm down and explained that he did not fail the test, theywe just having a few students do it again.    When husband and I tried to talk to him about the situation, he kept saying we were making him angry by bringing it up.    My husband and I do not know how to handle this.    Does he need help?    I think he needs to be punished, grounded for his behaviors and that we should never in any kind of way give in.    My husband thinks we need to talk to him and not punish.    Thanks in advance for any advise you may have."

DEMO	Possible Late O, No AF, EWCM, High temps! Preggo or not?	Hello girls,I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on this.I have been ttc for 15 months.I just had an HSG done on Spet.13th.I was supposed to O about a week after that.But, never did.I use an OPK and I never got a positive.But, most importantly I never got high temps.My AF was due Oct.1st and I never got it.But 4 days before she was due I had LOTS of EWCM.So for the heck of it I decided to start temping again.My temps were WAY up.And are still up.I am now 10 days late for AF with NO sign of her arrival.I did have AF like cramps about a week and a half ago when she was supposed to come but never did.My stomach has been feeling weird lately,kinda like a muscle spasm on and off.I have been feeling sick and my boobs have gotten bigger.Also I've had odd headaches on and off and have felt VERY light headed.I'm wondering is it possible to have O'd right before AF was due and gotten pregnant?I'm trying to find an explanation for the EWCM, the high temps and no AF along with the other symptoms I've been experiencing.This is the first time AF has ever been late.The latest she has ever been was almost 5 days.And I've never gone a month without ovulating.I always had a positive OPK and my temps always went up.What do you ladies think?Have you ever heard of someone ovulating right before AF and getting pregnant?Please help!Any input would be great.I figured if it did happen, it's still too early to test.I would only be about 10 DPO.I was going to test next week if AF doesn't show.I REALLY don't think she is going to though.I appreciate your help!THANK YOU!BABY DUST TO ALL!

DEMO	Please help. Diagnosed with UTI then told its yeast infection	I went to the ER yesterday because I was having symptoms of a UTI. It hurts when I urinate. It doesnt burn its just painful. I constantly feel like I have to pee but when i go barely anything will come out and im in pain after that. So the antibiotics they prescribed me yesterday made me feel very sick to the point i had to go home from work. So i called the ER and they told me to come back in. This is only 24 hours after being diagnosed with a UTI from a urine specimen. I did another urine test and the doctor told me it did not test positive for a UTI so they did a pelvic exam and told me I have a yeast infection and to stop the antibiotics and start using monistat.Ive had UTIs and yeast infections before. This does not feel like a yeast infection. I have no burning or itching or cottage cheese like discharge. Im at a loss for what to do. I have no insurance and i cant keep running to the er but my symptoms arent getting any better. I've already missed 3 shifts at work due to the original symptoms and how sick the antibiotic made me. Do i need to go get another opinion or just try the monistat and see how that works??I'm so confused and upset. I just want to feel better.

PREG	Aggressive Four Year Old	"My son and I recently took an afternoon to spend together alone.    After weeks of wanting to go bowling I took him last Saturday.    He is very competitive and started getting frustrated when I had more points than him.    When his turn was over he started getting very angry.    I sat down next to him to explain that he gets to bowl twice, and then I get to bowl twice.    While trying to explain this to him, he slapped me across the face!    I was devastated and shocked.    I said ""Get your shoes on, we are leaving"".    I paid for the unfinished game and turned in our shoes.    We went to the car and I started crying.    This only seemed to make him more upset.    I told him we do not hit.    This is something he knows.    He has been told this repeatedly, as he occasionally will hit his younger brother (20months).When he was two he had a really hard time with hitting.    We worked on this behavior and I thought we had gotten over the worst of it.    He no longer and hasn't for a long time, hits other kids for toys, etc....    He is very competitive and particular about the way things are done.    But clearly, hitting Mom is way out of line.    What do I do?    I don't think this is normal behavior for a four year old....."

FAML	4 year old sassy and not very nice	"I have a 4 1/2 year old going on 16.    She has a very sassy mouth to everyone(not in school) but to me and her father other adults.    When I try to repremand her her response is ""Whatever"" and she flips her hand at me.    It's like she doesn't care about anyone's feelings.    It's very embarrasing.    She does it so often that it's hard to put her in time out anymore because she would live in time out.    I think she thinks she is being funny.    How do handle this?"
FAML	Fecal Smearing - Child	My (7 year old) step-son recently smeared his feces in the bacthroom as if it was fingerpaint. This is not the first time he has done it, just the worst it has ever been. When asked why he did it, he replied that he missed his mother. (He lives in another state with his mother.) He was sexually molested by his mother's nephew (his cousin, also a minor) a few years ago and did see a doctor for a little bit. His mother is in the process of another divorce, they moved out of the home and into a hotel with her 20 year old boyfriend and her soon to be ex husband has custody of the 2 foster children they were attempting adopt. The obvious answer is for him to see a specialist/doctor, but his mother refuses. What can we do?
FAML	shy 9 year old	9 year old son is shy outside of our house, around other people. But in front of people, he rarely smiles or speaks. He has a few friends, but no best friend. He seems a little nervous when meeting new people. Should I be worried something has happened in his past that has traumatized him or will he break out of his shell when he gets ready?    Thanks in advance.
FAML	Bad Behavior at new daycare	"My 4 yr old son got kicked out of his daycare about 2 weeks ago for bad behavior.    They just plain gave up on helping us.    Now he is in a new one in the next town because we only had one in the small town we live in.    He's had a hard time adjusting to the new one.    I talked to his teacher when he started and told her everything that went on at the other one so they would know what is going on.    He would have a tantrum and then throw chairs or toys and time out never worked.    Now at the new one he would do really good for about 3 days and then have a bad day to where he would pitch a fit which lead to throwing chairs, etc.    He been there for 12 days and has had 3 ""bad"" days.    He had a bad day Friday and now they don't know if he's allowed back on Monday.    I have talked to our pediatrician several times about his behavior and I finally asked her to recommend an adolescent counselor which we are going to this week.    He only acts like this at school and not at home.    I don't know why he thinks he can get away with it there, we talk to him all the time about listening to his teachers and doing what they ask him to do.    It seems that they are giving up on us too.    We are doing our best to try and help our son but we can't find a daycare who is willing to work with us.    He starts PreK next year and we don't want this behavior there too."

DISE	PVCs same time of day	Occassionally I will have runs of PVCs and PACS that last for an hour or so and seem to go away as long as I am sitting down quietly.     Anyway, I have been having these for several months now and they almost always are between 5pm and 10pm.     Anybody have anything similar?    I asked my doc and he just looked at me and said he had no idea.    Seems kinda weird that they almost always happen in that time frame.    I have them throughout the day but randomly here and there, not in runs and sometimes even bigemeny (like tonight).

FAML	Sexual Exploration 9 year old boy with neighbor boys	My son and several friends were introduced to some fairly explicit sexual material about 1 year ago by a same-sex friend of the same age who apparently was introduced to this material by older boys.When this incident originally happened we took immediate action by explaining that this behavior was unacceptable and inappropriate. We conferred with the other parents involved and set fairly strict rules governing their play time together. No bedrooms, no closed doors, etc.It has been one year and we were feeling pretty comfortable that this was nipped in the bud.    However, this week we found out that our son and another boy from the original group were involved in this behavior again. They show eachother their private parts and apparently encourage erections.My husband and I, as well as the other boys parents are completely freaked out. We have talked with our son extensively, but is this enough? Should we seek counseling?

SOCL	The Easiest Way To Live Longer	Did you know that every minute you walk can extend your life by 1.5 to 2 minutes? In addition, many studies show that people who walk regularly live longer, weigh less, have lower blood pressure, and enjoy better overall health than non-walkers.Ready to lace on your shoes? If you want to add to the amount of walking you do, just clip on a pedometer. That simple action actually increases your physical activity by over 2100 steps per day, a review that pooled data from 26 studies found.HereÃ¢ € ™s a look at ten benefits of walking.Walking Increases Your LifespanWalking more than an hour a day improves life expectancy significantly, a 2011 study showed. The researchers looked at 27,738 participants between the ages of 40 and 79 over a 13-year period. Surprisingly, their lifetime medical costs did not increaseÃ¢ € ”even though they lived longer.Ã¢ € œAn increase in walking time at the population level would bring about a tremendous change in peopleÃ¢ € ™s health and medical cost,Ã¢ €  the study authors wrote.Walking Wards Off DiabetesJust thirty minutes of walking a day can prevent diseases such as type 2 diabetes, a 2002 study looking at both overweight and average weight men and women in a population at high risk for the disease showed.If you already have diabetes, walking is helpful for you, too. A mile or more daily cuts your risk of death from all causes in half, according to a 2007 study.Walking Keeps Your Mind SharpWalking 72 blocks a week (around six to nine miles) helps increase grey matter, which in turn lowers the risk of suffering from cognitive impairmentÃ¢ € ”or trouble with concentration, memory and thought, according to a study which looked at 299 seniors over a nine-year period.Furthermore, walking five miles per week can provide some protection to the memory and learning areas of the brains of those already suffering from AlzheimerÃ¢ € ™s disease or mild cognitive impairment, and lead to a slower decline in memory loss.Walking Helps Lower Blood PressureWalking just 30 minutes a day, three to five days a weekÃ¢ € ”even when the 30 minutes are broken into three ten-minute incrementsÃ¢ € ”has been found to significantly lower blood pressure.Walking is Great for Bone HealthPutting one foot in front of the other for about a mile a day led to improved bone density in post-menopausal women, and slowed the rate of bone loss from the legs, according to a 1994 study. Ã¢ € œIt takes walkers four to seven years longer to reach the point of very low bone density, study leader Dr. Krall told the New York Times.Walking Cuts the Risk of StrokeWalking about 12.5 miles a week or more cut the risk of stroke in half, according to a study looking at over 11,000 Harvard University alumni with an average age of 58.Walking Improves Your MoodIf youÃ¢ € ™re feeling down in the dumps, walking is a quick and easy solution. Just thirty minutes on a treadmill reduces feelings of tension and depression, according to research published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine. In fact, the study found that walking lifted moods more quickly than anti-depressants did (and with fewer side effects).And the more people walk, the better their mood and energy, says California State University Long Beach professor Robert Thayer, based on a study looking at 37 study participants over a 20-day period.Walking Torches CaloriesJust 20 minutes of walking a day will burn 7 pounds a year. The effects are even more dramatic when you add in some dietary changes as well.Walking Improves InsomniaHaving trouble sleeping at night? Try taking a brisk 45-minute walk in the morning five days a week, and your sleep may improve significantly, according to research from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, which looked at women from the age of 50-74. (Walking in the evening, however, sometimes has the opposite effectÃ¢ € ”so keep an eye on when youÃ¢ € ™re exercising and what your sleep patterns are.)Walking is Good for the HeartWomen who took brisk walks for three or more hours per week reduced their risk of heart disease by 30-40 percent, according to an analysis of over 72,000 women aged 40-65, who were enrolled in the prospective NursesÃ¢ € ™ Health Study. As I reported recently, heart attacks kill more US women than men annually. However, the benefits of walking arenÃ¢ € ™t limited to one gender. A different study showed that walking can cut the risk of coronary heart disease in half for men between the ages of 71 and 93.http://health.yahoo.net/experts/dayinhealth/easiest-way-live-longer

DISE	Please Help	"My husband is a 29 year old african american who has been experiencing serious ""episodes"" that are occuring in clusters.    By this, I mean that last year about 7-9 months ago, he experienced symptoms for a few weeks.    It starts by him feeling more tired than usual, then he'll start having muscle pain, headaches.    What eventualy happens then are the ""episodes,"" his back pain gets intense, intense chest pain, shortness of breath, extreme fatigue, numbness and weakness in all of his limbs, cold/numb mouth, red blooshot eyes, headache, blurry vision.    Also about 6 months ago, he developed a lingering cough.    After an ""episode"" he is not himself at all, meaning fatigue, achy, frequent pangs in chest.    After a couple weeks (I don't remember how many times he got the attacks) the symptoms went away.    His cough developed but nothing else until a couple weeks ago; he's been extremely tired lately then last week he had two of the attacks.    During the second and last attack he had, I took him to the ER.    They didn't find much but did find elevated cpk results (530), slightly high urine ph (7.5), slightly low lymphocytes (23).    Other than this, he has a slightly low heartbeat according to an ekg.    We were fortunate enough to see a cardiologist today, they don't think it's related to his heart based on these and other results from the er, however they are doing one last ekcocardiogram.    He thinks we should try neurology as well and agrees that it's only persistence that will find us an answer."

FAML	Teen Thief Driving Wedge Between Father and Son	"My son's best friend is a criminal.    His own parents sent him to juvie.    My wife sides with my son on this one and has unending forgiveness for my son and his friend.    When he'd thought we'd all gone away on vacation, I stayed back because of work and as a result, I caught this boy breaking and entering into my home red handed.    He also had another guy with him who he helped climb through my window, this other guy was from a different city and was unknown by my son.When i caught them, they were apologetic and begged forgiveness.    I told them I would settle with my son not with them.My almost 18 son can not understand or believe my reaction (he was away on vacation at the time) and he despises me for ""the sh-t you've put me through"" because I demanded that my son pay for the broken window and I'd preferred that he beat the money out of his buddy for it too.    He believes he was in another State at the time and therefore had nothing to do with it.    Also, my son finds no fault with his friend, only with me for catching him and demanding that my son settle it himself.    He even apologiezed to his buddy for having such as *** for a Dad.    They claim they forgot their sunglasses in the house, but I point out that you don't need a crew and broken windows for that.He doesn't understand why I needed him to settle it himself and it has caused major damage to our relationship.

FAML	How can I help my son?	My son is 9 years old and just recently (within the last few weeks) started having irrational fears.    He has to sleep bathed in light from head to toe, with his door open, and persists to ask every night to sleep in my 6 year old daughter's room and for me to leave my door open.    He wakes up several times a night crying and then won't go back to sleep.    We end up waking up in the morning and he's either on the couch or in my daughter's room and all the lights in the house are on.    When I ask him what he is afraid of, he says he doesn't know and that he's just scared.    I've tried to play it off like it is a cry for attention, but he is actually scared.    Last night he woke up at two in the morning, paced around the house, and then woke my daughter up at 4 am.    He never went back to sleep.    It's even gone so far that now he will not go to the front bathroom, he insists on showering and using the restroom in my bathroom and only if I am in the room.    If he calls for me and I don't answer quickly he will literally jump out of the shower and run around the house looking for me freaking out.    I'm not sure where any of this is coming from!

DISE	Mass on left Ovary	I was in the ER late Friday night with severe pain in my right side - below my rib cage that radiated to my back in the general area of my kidney. I had already been treated the week before in the same ER for a UTI with antibiotics and a mild pain medication.    This new pain came out of no-where and would not go away with OTC medication - Aleve, Ibuprofen and Tylenol gave me no relief.After the ER physician reviewed a CT scan of my abdomen, he found a mass on my left ovary (about 5 cm). We are not sure if it is just a cyst, or a solid mass.    With my history of ovarian cysts during my teen years, I'm still very concerned. My concern is that I have no pain on my left side what-so-ever. My question is two-parts: First, how large is an ovary, and second, what are the chances of this particular mass being malignant (considering I am asymptomatic - other than the pain on my right side)?Thank you!

Everyday it's a battle to get him to school and even for the teachers to get him to do his school work. He continually asks the teacher if he can ""call his mom."" He is in the 3rd grade this year and in the previous years of grade school, my husband and I have never had this problem with him. I don't know what to do or how to handle the everyday situation?

SOCL	Ohio governor signs law allowing guns in bars	http://news.yahoo.com/ohio-governor-signs-law-allowing-guns-bars-224705191.htmlCOLUMBUS, Ohio (Reuters) - Ohio Republican Governor John Kasich on Thursday signed into law a bill that allows gun owners in the state to carry concealed weapons into bars and other places where alcohol is served.The measure, which was forwarded to Kasich on June 22 by the Ohio General Assembly, was signed on Thursday afternoon. Kasich is scheduled to sign the Ohio budget later Thursday.Businesses can ban concealed weapons on their premises for safety reasons if the want to and some, like the Cincinnati Bengals football team, have indicated they will continue to bar gun owners from bringing firearms into the stadium.The law also prohibits gun owners from consuming alcohol or being under the influence of alcohol or drugs when they carry their weapons into bars.The new laws allow residents to carry concealed handguns into licensed establishments in the state, including shopping malls and sporting venues.The new law also allows a person with a concealed carry license to transport a loaded handgun in a motor vehicle without securing it in a holster, case, bag or box -- and allows them to remove a handgun from a secure location.Opponents of the laws had said that mixing guns and alcohol would endanger public safety. Supports argued that the laws bring Ohio into line with other states that have concealed carry rules.

DEMO	Could constant nausea be caused by a hormonal imbalance?	I'm 20 years old and have been experiencing constant nausea for about 14 months...my doctor sent me to a gastroenterologist who did an upper endoscopy and said everything looked fine. Then finally, just about a month ago, they discovered that I had a large ovarian cyst (14 x 10cm), which I had surgery for two and half weeks ago; he also had to remove a small part of my ovary. Obviously I thought after the cyst was gone, the nausea would go away, but it hasn't!I am wondering if I could have some type of hormone imbalance? It seems like that could be linked to having the cyst, and I know my mom had imbalance problems when she was my age- and she also had a cyst just like mine. I've always had heavy periods, but I didn't think it was a big deal as long as I had them regularly. Lately I've been feeling lightheaded and kind of like I'm not fully awake, even though I'm getting plenty of sleep. I expected to get my period a few days ago, but because of the surgery I might skip a month anyway.I'm going to my surgery follow-up appt on Thursday and I'm looking forward to seeing what the gynecologist has to say. Would I likely have to go to an endocrinologist if I wanted to get my hormones tested? I guess an endocrinologist would be the next person I would want to see anyway if the gyno can't find the problem. I was just wondering if anyone knew anything about this! if anyone has experience with this I'd appreciate the input! Thanks :)

FAML	Inappropriate behavior	"Recently I caught my 6 yr old daughter with a male cousin showing each other their private parts, touching & kissing.    When asked what they were doing she said they were acting like they were married.    My husband & I are divorced & she never saw anything between us.    Then I caught her ""playing"" with herself.    Is this normal curiousity or cause for concern"
DISE	too much coughing	"My husband has had a cold for about 10 days now.    The past 3 days, he has been coughing alot, even with prescribed cough syrup.    Tonight he was coughing when I looked over and he was sitting limp and dispondent.    After about 30 seconds, he finally came around and says to me, ""what are you looking at?    What happened?""    After discussing with him what I had just witnessed, he says that sometimes when he coughs so hard, he will pass out.    He felt a pain in his head just before he passed out and when he came to, his skin was gray, he was clammy, and his eyes were glazed.    After a few minutes, he was fine.    I am concerned about this and would like to know what happened to him.     Thanks."
FAML	3yr loves bellies	any kids do anything similar to this? My 3 yr loves bellies. He has always done this. if he sees someone belly he wants to touch it. We have been at the mall and he'll see a girl wearing a short shirt and will go and lift her shirt to see her belly. another example is my SIL used to think it was cute that he wanted to see her belly and feel how soft it was. So she let him see and touch. Now he won't leave her alone. Everytime she comes over as soon as she sits down he'll ask her to see her belly. When he was younger everyone thought it was a cute thing to do so family and freinds would show their bellies to him. But when I started to noticed that he wanted to do it to everyone where ever we went I started to tell him not to. Usally he'll stop, But every so often I' ll see him trying to look a someone belly. Like we were at a playland and I heard him asking a 3 yr olf girl can I see your belly. She thought he was funny. I went and told him not and he didn't do it again. .i have asked his teacher about it at school and she said she hasn't seen him do it. i know at first I would laugh and so would most people so maybe he thinks its something to get attention for. But I stopped thinking it was cute a long time ago. He don't do it as often but every so often he will.I know this sounds really odd. I just not sure what to think about this. I never heard of a kid doing this before. ThanksBnik

FAML	Strange thing with my 5 year old hearing voices	I have a 5 yr old boy that recently started Kindergarten.    He was in daycare all his life, pre-school etc.    Kindergarten has been a little hard for him sometimes behaving.    Not daily or anything like that, my Wife and I have not really been tolerant to the notes home.Anyway, yesterday at the store he told his mom that he heard a voice telling him that his Mother was stupid.    This really upset her.    He told her it kept saying it.    Then on the way out to the car I heard him whisper my Mom isn't stupid.    Now I don't know if he was saying that to appease his upset mother or what.    Not really observing what happened I looked him dead in the face and told him to knock it off.    I asked him right after bucking him in if he still heard the voice and he said no but started asking questions.    Hes an advanced kid, talked early and all that stuff.    His story telling and imagination is very advanced, always was.    He can talk his way out of a lot.    Hes not a badly behaved kid and liked by all his friends, teachers etc.    Anyway, During the ride home he said he hears talking in his head a lot.    I asked him if it was his voice and he said yes.Later that night when I had him alone.    I asked him if he heard it in his head and just said it out loud and explained to him about thoughts and your own voice.    I talk to myself a lot.    So does my father.    I mean in our head not out loud.    I am the kind of person that constantly problem solves in my head.    Hes also an very concerned kid, thinks and asks about EVERYTHING.    Anyway, hes never mentioned it before.    I have to admit there is a fair amount of verbal arguing in the house.    I'm sure that doesn't help with all the pressure he is under.    I wonder if we just need to calm things down for him and are there other triggers that I should look out for.The only other thing he has complained about is a headache now and again when hes tired.    Its rare and goes away on it own.    He has amblyopia (lazy eye) in one eye and gets patched so when he is over tired can get a headache but again, we are not even talking 5 times in his life.    Eye doctor says this is normal.I am thinking I have an overly imaginative kid who is a little too analytical for his own good.    I also think maybe all the yelling in the house is stressing him.    He might have even heard me say to my wife your being stupid, who knows. I am obviously concerned and even more upset that we have done this to him indirectly.    He such a caring, loving kid.    Shows a ton of affection etc.I have read about OCD on his board but I really haven't seen any sign of that that I would know about. No issues with moods or anything either.    What do you think?
FAML	Mother in PVS- should 4 yr old visit?	"My sister is in a persistent vegetative state a month and a half after a severe car accident. She is not responding to commands.    Her normally waist length hair has been shaved, she has a trache (sp?), scar on her head and appears very ""frail"".    Her 4 year old daughter has not seen her yet. My sister always made a big deal out of seeing her daughter and now she won't even be able to recognize her or respond - is it a good idea or not?I think not, I think it will be traumatic for her daughter.    How can you possibly understand something like this at 4? Am I wrong?"

SOCL	Should I stop daughters series of shots of Gardasil?	I didn't research this vaccine and now am hearing about all of these complications and death associated with Gardasil. My 14 year old daughter has received two of the three shots. What happens if i choose not to give her the third shot, because at this point i absolutely do NOT want her to have it. I am worried that this vaccine, being as it hasn't been tested properly or time tested that it may have long term effects. What if i chose for her to have this vaccine and later she is unable to have children? or it causes some other complication? You know i didn't allow her to have the Varicella shot (hoping that she would finally get chicken pox), but finally had to give it to her because it is required for a military family. I fought against that vaccine so long, i feel horrible that i dropped the ball on this one and just got pressured into it. They didn't even properly explain what its for, i didn't know its for STDs, I did wonder why it wasn't offered to my age group, i even asked but got a non answer. Anyway, any help would be appreciated....worriedmom74This discussion is related toGardasil Side Effects.
SOCL	Walgreens won't sell over-the-counter genetic test after FDA raises questions	"Walgreens won't sell over-the-counter genetic test after FDA raises questionsBy Rob SteinWashington Post Staff WriterThursday, May 13, 2010The nation's largest drugstore chain backed out Wednesday of plans to sell a saliva test that promised to scan a customer's DNA to assess his or her risk for breast cancer, heart attacks and a host of other diseases.Walgreens had planned to offer the Pathway Genomics test at more than 6,000 of its 7,500 stores nationwide beginning Friday, but it reversed course after the Food and Drug Administration questioned whether the test could be sold legally without the agency's authorization.""In light of the FDA contacting Pathway Genomics about its genetic test kit and anticipated ongoing discussions between the two parties, we've elected not to move forward with offering the Pathway product to our customers until we have further clarity on this matter,"" said Jim Cohn, a Walgreens spokesman.The Washington Post reported Tuesday about plans by Pathway and Walgreens to start selling the over-the-counter test. Pathway said its Insight test could evaluate a propensity for developing medical conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and obesity; the likelihood of parenting a baby with cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease and other genetic disorders; and the possible reaction to caffeine, cholesterol-lowering drugs, blood thinners and other medications.Other companies have been selling on the Internet tests that can analyze genes for a person's risk of some diseases, and genetic tests for paternity and ancestry have been widely available in stores. But the plan by Pathway Genomics of San Diego represented the boldest move yet to bring personalized genomic science to the mass market.It was welcomed by those who hope that deciphering the genetic code will launch a new era in biomedical science. But it raised objections from those who worried that the average consumer would have problems interpreting the results, leading to dangerous complacency about some diseases or unnecessary alarm, as well as opening the door to privacy violations, genetic discrimination and other problems.An FDA official told The Post on Monday that the test required the agency's authorization because it involved consumers collecting their own DNA. Company officials disputed that, saying the test was exempt from FDA oversight because the testing was being done at its own lab.But in a letter to Pathway released by the agency late Wednesday, the FDA's James L. Woods notified the company that the test ""appears to meet the definition of a device"" under federal law, therefore making it subject to the agency's review.""If you do not believe that you are required to obtain FDA clearance or approval . . . please provide us with the basis for that determination,"" the letter stated.In a statement Wednesday, Pathway said: ""We respect and understand Walgreens' decision, and we are communicating with the FDA"" about the test.Experts have long called for the FDA to regulate the burgeoning field of genetic testing more aggressively, and some speculated that the agency's move could mark a change in policy.""Walgreens is clearly acting in the interest of its customers by postponing the introduction of the Pathway product,"" said Sharon Terry of the Genetic Alliance, an advocacy and research group. The ""FDA, for its part, must be the guardian of safety and efficacy, all the while encouraging innovation and the benefits that genetics can bring to medicine."""

TRMT	What to do about chronic vitamin D deficiency	I was just found to have low levels of Vitamin D for the third time in the last year and a half.    I've been having various symptoms during that time, including joint pain, eyes that are sensitive to light and generally a little poorer vision than before, and heartburn or acid reflux (though that symptom has improved a lot).    I received numerous tests for those symptoms, and the vitamin D deficiency was the only thing that the tests found.    The previous two times I tested low for vitamin D, my doctor had me take 50,000 units once a week, for 8 weeks the first time and 12 weeks the second time.    I never noticed any improvement in my symptoms after taking the vitamin D, though my vitamin D level improved to a normal level.    I take a multivitamin daily which contains vitamin D, and also drink orange juice fortified with vitamin D and calcium, but that hasn't seemed to prevent my vitamin D level from becoming low again after I stop taking the high doses of vitamin D.I was wondering if I should be taking a relatively high level of vitamin D all the time, rather than just for a couple months at a time.    Is it normal to have low levels of vitamin D even when you are getting some from a multivitamin and fortified juice, or might that indicate I'm not absorbing it well?    Also, since I never saw any improvement with my symptoms after taking high doses of vitamin D, could that be because my vitamin D level wasn't in the normal range for a long enough time for my symptoms to improve, or might that mean that the vitamin D deficiency isn't the actual cause of the symptoms?    Could the vitamin D deficiency itself be a symptom of whatever is causing the other symptoms, or is it more likely that it is the root cause of the problem?
SOCL	Short-term memory problems	I've been experiencing some really irritating short-term memory loss problems (for myself as well as other people).    I am 35, female and trying to figure out why and how I can improve this.    Ther are a few things I have considered...I was in an auto accident last year.    I was t-boned and the driver side airbag went off and pretty much saved my life.    I had whiplash and have experienced a little neck pain ever since, but the emergency responders said I was okay at the scene of the accident, had me turn my head a bunch of different ways, checked my response etc.    Could this mess up my memory?    The reason I wonder if it is something else is because I have always been a little scatter-brained, but it has gotten noticably worse.    Could this be hormonal?    I also have depression and take 50 mg of Zoloft.    It makes me a little drowsy, but when I'm off it, I find it even harder to concentrate.    I've started taking brain and memory enhancement supplements.    These helped a little, but not a lot.    I checked out the brain games, crossword puzzles etc.    I feel a little more confident about stuff, but people will ask me to do somethinga nd a minute later I will already have forgotten to do it.    I do in fact feel very multi-tasked.    If there is a way to describe it, I am overly-multi-tasked on the job and my home life is also quite busy.    Should I get tested for ADD?    Am I starting the downward spiral into Dementia and Alzheimers? I'd like to sharpen my thought processes enough to wear its something more excusable.    Like I said it is pretty annoying.    I forget and mix up dates, priorities, names, things I need to remember to do and buy.    I walk down the stairs to get something and have to walk back up them and backtrack just to remember what it was I went downstairs to get.    Help!

TRMT	High metabolism all my life	"I am a 34 year old female and only 100 pounds. I have always been thin (and many of my friends and family say ""blessed"" by being thin). That is one of the reasons I moved from the Midwest to the Southwest-because I had no ""meat"" on my bones in the winter and thus could never get warm. I am healthy in every other way (except I am taking meds for depression, which I am currently trying to decrease the dose). I eat healthy, most days 3 meals a day; on the weekends maybe only 2 meals a day. I have recently begun drinking protein shakes with a combination of rice/hemp/whey protein. I am lactose-intolerant, so can only drink rice or almond milk, and not a vegetarian.I also work in the herb dept. at an Ayurvedic alternative health clinic. My coworker, who is an herbalist, recommended the protein shakes to me, along with some dietary suggestions.    I am trying to eat more pancakes, but I don't always have time to make them. I am trying to make healthy recipes from an Ayurvedic cookbook which are recommended for my body type, which is called Vata (for those interested in Ayurveda, which is the thousands-year old philosophy of health from India, you may learn more at www.ayurveda.com, or do your own search). It's kind of time-consuming cooking in the kitchen all the time, when none of my efforts at eating healthy seem to put any weight on my body. However, I don't want to go the way of eating fast-food all the time, although once in a while I do get cravings for cheeseburgers and I satisfy them!I've been tested for celiac disease (which I don't have), for thyroid problems (which I don't have).And just to be clear, I am NOT anorexic, I truly want to fill out, and not look like a teenager- I want to look like I'm 34!Does anyone have any recipe suggestions or websites that could help me gain weight?"

FAML	how to be a leader??	My 6 Year old son is a normal healthy boy.He is quite friendly and very loyal in his friendships.Problem is that he quite often feels that children doesn't like him and don't want to be friends with him although i don't seem to analyse any reason for it.He likes to be friends with more outgoing and sporty boys but when he befriends them he tends to become a follower doing just as they instruct and it does occur to me that he is lacking leadership qualities.sometimes,he may be more capable but he takes a backseat with his domintaing friends just so that they still remain friends with him.A boy whom he considers his best friend and really likes is very dominating and makes him follow him.when they 2 are alone he'll be playing with him but as soon as a third boy comes along he ignores my son and starts playing with him.i realize my son feels deeply hurt by his attitude.if my son tries to make new friend that best friend of him doesn't let him do that.it seems my son is besotted by him that he is not ready to listen anthing against him and it truly breaks our heart to see that boy hurting my son every time.he doesn't say anything to us but sometimes i find him sitting alone depressed.what should we do?? please help
FAML	Behavior Problems with my Almost 4 Year Old Boy	I feel like I am out of options when it comes to disciplining and working on behavioral issues with my almost 4 year old boy. We have tried a variety of methods and none seem to work. I read a lot of information on behavior issues and discipline but the standard line is to be consistent. We are consistent. We do not back down from the rules and he always gets caught and has to go through punishment, but it does not seem to make a difference. The biggest issue is that there seems to be a major control issue that goes on, but I don't know if there is more to it. It started out with tantrums. Besides the normal ones at home, once he seemed to realize he couldn't get away with them there he would wait until we were out in public and then try to do whatever he wanted. This was about a year ago. He would try to sit up in the cart and stand and I would tell him to sit down. He would look around and then right at me and smile and slowly stick his foot back up to stand. When I would get him out he would start to scream and throw a fit. So every time we went out in public this would happen in some form so we would take him to the car and he would have to sit in there until he screamed it out. Eventually this stopped, but he just moved on to something else. The next thing became playing in bed. He shares a room with his brother and they have bunk beds. Well, he would play in bed for hours. He would grab onto the bars from the bed above and swing on them. Jump around, etc. We have a video monitor so we would catch him every time. He would go to time out and lose privileges. This lasted around two months an then he transferred his behavior to preschool. First it was running away from the teacher and laughing and not doing what she would say. Oh, he also has an issue with women. He does not listen or obey as well as he does with men. Then it was water. He also has an issue with this. An obsession about water and if allowed he will drink and drink and not stop causing him to pee himself continually. So then he tried to sneak water all the time. Then when that stopped he started intentionally peeing himself. He would stand up in the middle of circle time, spread his legs and pee in front of everyone and he is fully potty trained. This went on for a few months. Then school ended and now the peeing has stopped but he has started to throw fits in time out and in public. He doesn't throw himself on the ground    anymore, but whines and cries for hours especially in public when he doesn't get his way and he has been playing in bed again. He just seems to move through various issues after each ones eventually doesn't work after months of trying it. We give time outs, take away toys, lost privileges. He doesn't get to do certain things when his brother does when he has been bad. We have a chart with stickers and if they get a certain amount they get a piece of candy and if more a toy. He doesn't care about this. He shows off his x's to people instead of the stickers. We thought he might like the negative attention so we try ignoring him. Still has consequences like time out but he gets ignored in time out and then has to play by himself instead of getting attention. Nothing works. He doesn't seem to care. He just keeps doing it. I have no idea what to do and it is frustrating that everything we try seems to no avail and reading advice never seems to help as it is already what we do. Any suggestions?

I have tried reading with him,playing a game with him,drawing with him....everything.

Also, he is REALLY smart here at home when we do homework, but the teacher is telling me he is behind? He literally does all his homework correctly before I can even try to help him?

DISE	Do I have genital herpes?	I was recently tested for HSV 1-2.. the results came back positive for HSV 1. Now about 3 months ago I had some itching on my penis from 2 bumps and the Doc said it was folliculitis. He prescribe me some antibiotics and also gave me a shot on the spot, in a week or so the symptoms went away. That's until about a week ago.. the same symptoms recurred but this time the tiny bumps, pimple-like.. were resemblance of a rash near the exact spot of the last outbreak, itching. That's what lead me to further get tested.To further describe the bumps.. they are pimple-like.. and when viewed closer i can see very thin hairs stemming from the center of the bump and they itch. Once the itching stops they bust and begin to heal, sort of resembling a dimple, little hole in the middle, and the scab over.Thanks for any help.
PREG	thank you	I just wanted to say a huge thank you to all of u for your support and guidance through a difficult first time pregnancy. I could not have got through it without u and I'm very proud to announe the arrival of Elliot Christopher at 7.50am on 25 Aug. He weighed 6lb 10oz and following a drama filled labour (he was almost born at home!) after 40 mins of noted labour he came into the world. For those ftm in uk, please ensure u get checked internally if u think u r in labour they sent me home without doing so at 5.30 am without checking and told me I wasn't in labour cos they felt my contractions were too irregular and I didn't seen too be in enough pain when I had them. I was trying to stay calm and manage the pain through breathing techniques as taught by midwife so I could have a water birth! By 6am I was trying not to push and my husband was on the phone to hospital and paramedics. We r just happy that all is ok and our baby is perfect, we even left the hospital at 1pm the same day!

SOCL	Cheap, lying boyfriend	I've been with my boyfriend for a year in half, when I first met him I was not attracted to him. But I knew he was a nice guy and he was very different from the thugs I was used to dating, so I gave him a chance. I just turned 30 so I figured I needed to step out of my comfort zone and try somehing new. As the relationship progressed I got to know him an found out that he was a really nice southern family guy with respect....He lost his business 9 months ago, so money is looking funny. I picked up a second job because I was used to him giving me leisure money, so that my paycheck was    just for bills. He hasn't found a job yet and its putting a strain on our relationship. Now I found out that he's a liar...the business he had wasn't even his. He was just the manager. And he constantly keeps lying about his finances.    What should I do?

FAML	My 5 year old hears voices.. is she really?	"My almost 5 year old daughter has informed me several times, the most recent time yesterday that she hears voices talking quietly in her head.    This last voice she explained was while she was at preschool and it quietly said, ""Stupid"".     I think previously it has said things like, ""spongebob"" or maybe sang a familiar song.I know it sounds silly... but she very clearly described the voice as coming from her own head.    I have three children a 4 year old, her (5 years old) and a 7 year old.    All girls.    All very different.     I'm a single parent and have absolutely no experience with anything like this.. I don't really know what to tell her...Like I said, she brought it up recently like she was a little worried.    I didn't know what to say.    I told her I believed her and asked her if she recognized the voice and asked her if maybe she was thinking the words so much that she kept thinking them and couldn't get them out of her head... and she said, ""no mommy....    it's like the voice is in my head""    I told he to let me know if she hears the voices again.She will be 5 in July.    Should I take her somewhere?    I mean, do I ask her every day if she heard any voices in her head today?    Do I ignore it until she brings it up again? What is normal?"

Recently had a new outbreak of 2 bumps. Rather than squeeze them and risk spreading it, I am using benzoyl peroxide 10% and within a few days it already seems better.

This is what I did/    I made him clean up the mess, I sat sdown and talked to him, made him pick out his punishment (which was to go to bed for a total of 2 hours until dinner) Tell his father what his did.

SOCL	KTW Syndrome	My daughter was born with KTW.    She was seen in the genetics clinic at the children's hospital.    She has a large hemangioma that covers most of her back, part of her right arm/hand, the right side of her abdoman and some small spots on her left buttock/upper thigh.    My concern is about her foot and left ring finger.    Her left foot is 1 1/2 cm bigger than her right and her second toe is much longer on that foot as well.    Her ring finger on her left hand is bigger than the rest of her fingers.    I am concerned that they will continue to grow at an abnormal rate and that could present problems when she learns to walk.    She is going to be evaluated for OT--when she was born her hands were fisted and the thumb was over the middle finger and held them down and it is difficult for her to extend them.    Any information you can give me would be appreicated.    The Dr. in the genetics clinic is just monitoring her at this point and she will go back in six months.
TRMT	Tetanus booster for a broken arm with no skin injury?	My 14 year old son broke both bones in his arm above the wrist this afternoon.    He did not sustain any wounds to the skin.

DISE	Problems occurring after yeast infection	A few months ago, I had sudden pain in which felt like the tract of my penis about once a week. I then noticed redness just below the head on my upper shaft. I decided to go the doctor and she immediately diagnosed it as a yeast infection. She gave me nystatin cream to use for two weeks and it worked for about a week. Then, it started to feel uncomfortable again. Also, I noticed a small red patch just under the head. I returned to the doctor exactly two weeks after my original visit, and she was unsure about the patch. She said that she would feel safe doing a blood test and a penile probe. I thought that an STD check was pretty much out of the question because I started having sex with my current girlfriend, now fiance, about 2 years ago and was virgin before that. She was thoroughly tested and is STD free. The tests came back negative and the doc recommended me to a urologist. However, now I never feel any pain, but it the urinary tract is still sensitive at times and that small red patch is still there in the same spot. It never has hurt when I urinate, but every now and then a while after I ejaculate, it feels pretty sensitive. What could this be?

DISE	Moderate Regurgitations and PACs,stress, high BP	Hi there. I recently had a dobutamine echo due to chest pains and palpitations.    I have started having high BP and have been on toprol for that. The results of the echo (read by my internal med doc) states that I have moderate mitral valve regurgitation. Ok.. I know that can be fine for a long time. But they also said that I have a junctional rthym issue, with PAC's during stress. My blood pressure has spiked to 186/110 and remained at least 150/100. This even after being on Benacar AND toprol. She has now doubled my toprol to 50mg and benicar is at 20. per day. She is obviosuly worried more about my high bp than anything, so doesnt suggest i see a heart doc as of yet. She also put me on seroquel to mellow my body out...? AND has given my lorazepam for anxiety to not get my heart going...Does this sound like a good plan? I am tired all of the time, and now REALLY tired due to the seroquel. She thinks that all these meds combined will help my bp and therefore solve the rythm PAC issue. Can someone please give an opinion, and now I am just struggling to make it to work everyday!

DISE	My doctor said I had hyperthyroidism, but I have more symptoms of hypothyroidism.	"I'm 21 years old and I have a slightly large goiter on my neck. I have had it for maybe 4 years, but never paid much attention to it until I started noticing it got somewhat larger, and there was an occasional sharp/stabbing pain. I went to my doctor, she ran blood tests, and she told me that I had hyperthyroidism, so I went home and searched on the internet all the symptoms, and it seems as though I have the opposite. But when I really analyze it the symptoms are basically split in half. I know with most conditions symptoms vary from person to person, but I just find that strange. Is there any possible chance my doctor was wrong and it's actually HYPOthyroidism? How do I go about asking her about that? I don't want to seem like a ""know-it-all"" patient, trying to self-diagnose myself with research off the internet. I'm going back next week to discuss my ultrasound results and get started on treatment.Also, I'm a little worried about having Thyroid Cancer. I know it's rare, but there is a pain in my neck right where the goiter is. It's not a constant pain, there is just an abrupt sharp/stabbing pain which occurs a couple times a day perhaps. I feel as though all this waiting is driving me insane and I don't want to wait until next week.If anyone has any advice or answers I'd appreciate it. Thanks."

DEMO	getting raped on your period	ok so not too long ago i got drunk and was taken advantage of and practically raped. i was also on my period at this time. and i really cant remember what happened but im pretty sure this person didnt use pertection and im really scared about being pregnant. its almost been two weeks now since it happened and ive looked up symtoms(symptoms)of early pregnancy but so far none. and it happened the night my period started but it started early that morning. and i freaked out the next day terribly and a lot of people told me that you couldnt get pregnant on your period but we all know its possible right? and for that month i had to skip my BC pills because i was too late on taking them that month but i started taking them again like two days after it happened, while i was still on my period. it made my period stop and everything. but what do you really think my chances are of being pregnant?

FAML	2 year old depressed?	My ex and I initially separated when our daughter was 19 months old.    At that point in time, she acted out, throwing tantrums, etc.    It was very evident that her little world as she knew it was interrupted.    We were separated for 2 months.    She was ecstatic to having us live back together.    We lived together for another 10 months and have again separated as of last month.    She will be 3 in January and I am curious if it is possible that she could be depressed???She is acting withdrawn at daycare and really doesn't want to go to school.    Yesterday her school called to find out if she had any medicine before school because she was very sleepy and not social in general.    Her dad picked her up and brought her to his mom and she slept all day long.    This morning on the way to school and often a lot of other mornings, as we near the school, she says she doesn't want to go.    Today when I called to check on her, they said she is going in and out.    Sometimes she participates, laughs and smiles and sometimes she fades out and becomes droopy again.Do children this age go into depression due to separation?    Or is it a normal cycle of behavior?Thanks,Jennifer

DISE	Elevated TSH, Ft4 normal and Hashimoto's	In 2003 I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease, since then I take my medicins. Nothing went wrong until a couple of months when my doctor told me to lower the medicins, which I did. I use Thyrax (Dutch name don't know the English name, sorry) and I had to lower from 150 till 100 and then on to 75 mcg a day. With 100 mcg a day my TSH was 0,02 so I had to lower again to 75 mcg a day. My blood is checked every week now and my TSH went from 0,02 tot 10 to 13 to 18 to 20 dropped to 15 to 10 and three weeks ago to 2. Yesterday it went up again to 23 and my Ft4 is doing well and is regularly steade (13, 15, 16). I am not feeling sick or whatever. But it worries me a lot that my TSH is behaving like a rolling coaster. My doctor asked me if I do take my medicine (YES). Could it be that I have a adenoma or something like that in my pituary??This discussion is related toHigh TSH and antibodies but normal FT4.

GOAL	Lotemax dosage?	I went to the eye doctor yesterday, and I got a prescription for Restasis for my dry eyes. Along with that, I got a prescription for Lotemax, for more immediate relief (to help prevent inflammation I guess). I remember that my doctor said to put one drop of the Restasis in my eyes once in the morning, and once at night, but I can't remember what he said for the Lotemax. I THINK he said one drop in each eye four times a day, but I might be thinking of Theratears, which we didn't get. Does four times a day sound like too much? It makes me nervous to use it because they said it was a steroid, so I definitely don't want to use it too much. I'm 19 years old, and I've worn glasses since I was 9 (and I live in the desert), if that helps.

GOAL	Nitrous Oxide	My 9 year old son had some dental work done today.    He had 5 fillings on one side of his mouth.    They used Nitrous Oxide and said that he should be totally relaxed and do just fine.    3 of my other children have had nitrous oxide for fillings and did just fine.    However my son today vomited during the procedure.    Which they immediately extracted with their suction.    They said that this does happen some times.    In looking this over at information online, I have seen it say that this occurs when over sedation occurs.    My son remembers that he vomited, but what seems to bother him most is he said he was so dizzy and felt like he was spinning the whole time.    And that he was in a inclosed small space the whole time.    So I'm assuming he was claustrophobic.    He has to go back to get a few more fillings, and I'm wondering if he should not have the nitrous oxide?    Has anyone out there ever experienced vomiting during the procedure when having the laughing gas?    My other concern is if he doesn't have it, and he starts to gag or vomit that he'll freak out if he isn't lightly sedated.    I know from watching it, it was so scary to see him lying there vomiting, and not being able to do anything to help him, other than comforting him.    Any advice would greatly be appreciated.    Thank you!

SOCL	Lumps to left nipple all the way to the armpit and painful HELP?	I am a 35 yo male, good health, just the noramal HTN and lack of exersice...However the other day when putting on deodorant I noticed a painful knot/lump in my left armpit. I didnt mess with it or anything figured it was like an infected folical or something. The next morning I woke up and the lump was still there yet now there was another one bhind my left nipple and this one is very painful. Again didnt mess with it just applied heat off and on through out the day. Well today I wake up and there are many lups going from my nipple to my armpit and its painful and you can see that my left side is so much more swollen in the breast are compared to the right its red painful to touch and is just getting worse I think. THere was no trauma, or broken skin in both areas...oh but yesterday the areola was kinda oozing a clear fluid and was not the best smelling. I am going to try to wait till tomorrow to see my PMD dont need to fill up an ER when this is not a life or death issue, just wondering if anyone had thoughts on what this might be. I am not asking for a dx just some thoughts.

TRMT	B6 toxicity	I developed severe pins and needles, pain and burning in my right arm and right leg and foot about 4 weeks after topping my B6 supplement total to about 200+ mg daily, from all the various holistic practitoners giving me supplements. I have been in miserable pain for 9 weeks now. I have had to take Tramadol and diazepam throughout the day just to get by.I had to go to a neurologist- normal neuro exam, normal brain and spine MRI. I'm left with this parathesia and sciatica pain, and no one believes in B6 neurotoxicity, or has ever heard of it. I pushed my doctor to give me a requisition for a B6 level blood test. I'll get the results back in about a week. Thank goodness, some folks in this forum believe that what I'm going through is not just in my head. I don't know how to reverse the damage, if it can be reversed. Can magnesium help?
FAML	How to help my 5yr.old son make friends & like school	My 5yr.old son is having a very hard time making friends he has a weight problem which we are working on at this moment so he cant keep up with the other kids in his class. he is a very shy child and the neighborhood we live in has no other children for him to play with, he is not used to being around other kids so he is to scared to talk to the other kids when he finally worked up the nerve to ask another child to play with him the little boy didn't want to play with him. my son has Bi-Polar & ADHD (a bad connection) so he's on medication to help him but unfortunately the bi-polar medication doesn't seem to be helping. One day I decided to peek in on him while he was at recess and when I seen him out there I almost started to cry he was walking around with his head down crying he seen me and took off running to me I had to take him back over there even though I really wanted to take him home. from what he tells me he does that every day at recess,also when he comes home all he wants to do is sleep I ask him how how his day went and he say it was bad and begs me not to make him go back tomorrow. If anyone has any advice on my situation PLEASE,PLEASE HELP I open for any suggestion's and/or advice.                                                                                                                thank you                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        A Desperate Mother

SOCL	Does Tylenol Worsen Asthma For Kids?	"Does Tylenol Worsen Asthma For Kids?NPR 20 Feb 2012http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2012/02/20/147002356/does-tylenol-worsen-asthma-for-kidsParents and doctors around the world have been alarmed by the dramatic increase in childhood asthma.One factor in the upswing is better detection by doctors, but at least one doctor thinks a common over-the-counter drug also has something to do with it.Dr. John McBride sees lots of kids with asthma. He's a pediatric pulmonologist at Akron Children's Hospital in Ohio. He knew of studies that raised concern about the safety of acetaminophen Ã¢ € ” brand name Tylenol Ã¢ € ” to treat colds and fever in kids with asthma. So he decided to look more closely at the research.""I was stunned,"" he says. All the studies he looked at showed a link between asthma and acetaminophen.""The more acetaminophen somebody takes, the more likely it is that they have asthma,"" he says. ""Also, there's an incredible consistency. Everybody around the world who's looked for this association has been able to find it.""In asthma, the airways of the lungs get blocked by mucous and narrow. That leads to wheezing and shortness of breath. The rise in asthma has closely paralleled the increased use of acetaminophen.There are no scientific studies proving the medication causes asthma, but McBride says it may make asthma worse in kids who already have it.Nine-month-old Martez coughs and wheezes as McBride examines him and talks with his mom, Ceasha Moorer, about his asthma. ""He coughs. He wheezes. There are multiple symptoms,"" she says. ""He works very hard to breathe. When he's excited from crawling or even laughing, then he breathes really hard.""In the past when Martez got a cold, Moorer gave him Tylenol. But that seemed to make his symptoms worse. At McBride's suggestion, she stopped using it. Then one day, her aunt was looking after Martez when he had a cold.""I told her don't give him Tylenol,"" Moorer says. ""I didn't specify that it was acetaminophen. She actually gave him a cold medicine, but it seemed to make him kind of worse. I looked at the active ingredients and acetaminophen was in the active ingredients.""In fact, acetaminophen is an ingredient in many cough and cold products Ã¢ € ” including NyQuil, Robitussin and Theraflu. It might exacerbate the asthma because it decreases levels of a molecule called glutathione, which protects the lungs.""So removing the beneficial effect of glutathione exactly at a time children's lungs are being irritated might end up being just one factor that contributes to the onset of an asthma attack,"" McBride says.McBride's recommendation? Don't give acetaminophen to a child who has asthma. Other doctors say it's too soon for that advice.Many other factors could play a role in the rise of asthma, according to Dr. Stanley Szefler, head of pediatric pharmacology at National Jewish Health in Denver. ""Vitamin D insufficiency, dietary changes, air pollution or better control of infections are perhaps all related to the increasing prevalence of asthma,"" he says.Johnson & Johnson, maker of Tylenol, said in a statement that the medicine has been used safely and effectively for more than 50 years. ""There are no prospective, randomized controlled studies that show a causal link between acetaminophen, the active ingredient in Tylenol, and asthma,"" the company said.It's important to control a child's fever, Szefler says. McBride agrees but says ibuprofen is a safer bet Ã¢ € ” at least until ongoing studies provide answers about the safety of acetaminophen for kids with asthma."

FAML	Over Sensitive 5yo Boy	My son has become overly sensitive in the last 6-12 months.    He's a very active and loving little boy.    He has many friends and plays well with them.    He's doing well (average) in school (preschool) and is learning at a normal to slightly above normal rate.He is extremely attached to my husband.    A short while ago, it seemed that every morning he would cry when his dad would leave for work.    Hysterical crying.    That has gotten a bit better, so I'm not overly worried about that.However, if he wants something (stay up a little later, have someone lay down in his room with him while he goes to sleep, watch/play something on TV) and his request is denied, he begins to cry almost instantly.I've tried to remain calm with him and let him know that his crying is not going to change the subject...however, once in a while I do tend to get irritated and I get angry.    Same with my husband.We feel as though his sensitivity is a result of our frustration and we've been trying not to react that way, but it just doesn't seem to get much better.Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.    Thank you.

TRMT	leg pain/numbness after hysterectomy	I had my surgery 4 weeks ago using the da Vinci robot. Recovery is going well. However, when I left the hospital my thighs had some numbness on the surface and deep pain. The skin feels and looks odd, kind of scaley. When I mentioned it to the doctors and nurses, they thought it was due to the nerve irritation when lymph nodes were taken. Has anyone else had this type of pain?
FAML	Delayed Speech	"My 3 1/2 year old was born with a cleft in his soft palate which was repaired successfully at one year. He is still not talking well and many people except for myself, grandparents, aunts etc find it difficult to understand what he is saying. He has started school and the teacher has complained about his behavior. He sucks his forefinger (this started soon after I stopped his bottle last July), takes his shoes and socks off in class (we do this at home or when entering another person's home), suddenly gets up and wanders off when the teacher is teaching, shows difficulty in writing and understanding what she says. She says that he is immature for a child his age and fondles her breast and wants to be carried sometimes. He used a pacifier for the 1st year and we had to discontinue it after the repair. That was when he started touching my breast for comfort. I have told him not to do it and he hardly does it now. He started Speech Therapy 2 weeks ago and has improved already. But because of his lack of coherent speech his classmates do not understand him so he has no best friend as such but he does play football and run around with them. The school counsellor says that he might be Autistic because of this. I think that's an unfair diagnosis because of his cleft palate. He knows his colours, numbers 1-50, sings, can read alphabets and match words, do puzzles well. He babbles but also speaks in sentences of up to 4 words. When I sit with him, he writes his standing and    sleeping lines well, joins the dots, colours nicely and is constantly asking for evaluation by saying, ""Mama look, mama look.""    His ENT and Pediatrician say that he appears normal and intelligent to them. He loves going to school and calls his teacher his best friend but I think that he is frustrated that people cannot understand him and behaves like that. Is he Autistic?"
DISE	Possible bladder cancer	My Urologist suspects bladder cancer, but has not done a cystoscopy yet.    He has ordered an renal ultrasound and wanted me to come in for the cystocopy right after the ultrasound test.    However, his office called and cancelled cystoscopy test, as he has surgury, but when I tried to reschedule his office told me to have the ultrasound first and wait for the results before rescheduling the cystoscopy.My question is:    isn't the cystocopy the only real way to tell if there is bladder cancer?    should I be concerned that the office is not letting me schedule that procedure now?I just don't want to wait for the ultrasound test and then have to wait 2 weeks to get an appointment for the cystoscope after the results of the ultrasound.
TRMT	Where can we go to help him	I am a single mother with a 21 month year old Boy named Dmitri. He has medical problems from the day he was born. A week after being born, he had such a bad eczema problem he appeared to be wearing a mask of cradle cap. We found out that this a reaction from an allergy to breast milk and other food that I was eating. We later discovered that he is allergic to food in general and also to many other allergens. His only source of nutrition is a diet consisting only of a formula called EleCare. Even on the diet, he is constantly broken out and itching Due to many reasons. He also gets lots of flair up that consist of pus-filled and oozing sores on his body. This flair up causes him to be still getting up like a new born so he is often drained. He is on steroids and Atarax twice a day among many other medicines. Often, he is up to 15 different drugs and he takes the maximum dosage of each. I am worried about the long-term effects of these medicines. The doctors are now suggesting a feeding tube and that is a step I would like to avoid, if possible. They are also asking me to take him to a super specialist Doctor but I can't afford it because my insurance won't cover it due to it being out of state. I would like to ultimately be able to feed him something other than his formula and get him healthy enough to not need so many medications so; he can have a normal childhood. This is his last resort. If we can't get him to a Super specialist they're saying I might have to make funeral arrangements.

TRMT	17yr old son is sick to his stomach most of the time	My son is 17yrs old and I feel so helpless in trying to figure out what is wrong with him.    Since June of 2011, he has had terrible stomach pains, nauseated and throws up at least two or three times a week. He has undergone an ultrasound of his intestines, had several vials of blood drawn for tests, an endoscopy and a hydra scan too.    We thought he may have had celiacs disease, due to our middle son has it, but all tests say otherwise.    We also thought that maybe he has been having a tough time at school, but his grades are awesome and he has a lot of friends.    I don't think that he could possibly be being picked on, due to he is a black belt in Tae Kwon Do and working towards another belt in JuJitSu.    So I don't think it's a nervous condition.    The specialist is now short of doing a colonoscopy on my son to see if anything shows up there.    Has anyone experienced this, or any family members?

FAML	5 yr old son threw out of school please help me	my my son is 5yrs old he is really out of control it got that bad he was thrown out of school until he gets medical help. what happened was my son went to school and he nipped a wee girl so his teacher took him to the side and asked him why he did it he said i dont know so when they got to the class the another teacher told him to sit in an empty room but my son said no he didnt want to so he tried to run out but the teacher tried to stop him so he slapped her on her arm then another teacher told him go stand in the cloakroom but he refused he ran into another class with other pupil and started destroying the room the pupils in the class were then moved to a different room so no one got hurt four teachers surrounded my son to calm him down but all four got injured. After all this happened my son calmed down he cleaned up all the mess he made in the class and then taken to the office me and his dad were called to go to the school where they said to us not to bring him back until he has some medical help .in the school my son has a bahaviour form which he has to get happy faces each day and they also get which is called golden time which means 30 mins before the end of class they get to play with toys well he was told he wasnt aloud any golden time and he was getting a sad face on his behaviour form which obviously my son didnt not like it.could the school be causing my sons bad behaviour or could it be that me and his real dad have been broke up since he was a baby and every sunday his dad gets him for 8 hours but when he goes with his dad there is no discipline and he is aloud to do what he wants when he wants his dad also calls me names and when my son comes back he tells me what his dad has said i just tell him not to listen. but his dad is trying to take me back through the court for more contact which i dont think he should be getting as my sons behaviour is getting worse and i need to try and get things sorted with him before i start changing my sons routine my son is also urinating all over his room i have had to lift carpets because of him we tell him he cant do that it bad and dirty and hes a big boy now so he needs to pee in the toilet but he doesnt seem to listen and he is also hitting his sister and biting her i cant even leave him alone with her because i have came into his room to see him sitting on top of her punching her what makes this situation worse is im pregnant and im due in 5 weeks and im scared he will hurt this baby im soo stressed out at the moment i really need help could anyone give me advice on what the problem could be or how to fix it i cant live like this anymore

PREG	Has anyone had Metho shot for ectopic and then pain next ovulation/period on that...	"Hi, It's been a while. I had a metho shot for an assumed ectopic pregnancy in November (my HcG was only at 600 something and there was a 1 cm ""mass"" in the area of my right tube) and by mid/end December my betas were back to normal and I had bled out, with very little pain. In January I had a normal period, which would have resulted from ovulation on my left side. Last week, I got my period for this month, and it would have been my first resulting from ovulation on the right side, where the ectopic was. HOWEVER, my period was a week late and from the time I was ""supposed"" to start, and I had sharp pain on my right side, like I did with the ectopic pregnancy. Not horrible, but paiful enough. I did have what seemed like a normal period, along with three NEGATIVE pregnancy tests (1 the day after I was supposed to start and didn't, 1 the day before I actually did start, a week late, and one the fourth day after I started, when the bleeding stopped). So my question is this--why am I still having sharp pain on my right lower side?? It is like a muscle cramp or tear, and gets worse if I am really active, like driving our car (a standard :o)) and spreads into my hip and back and leg. Has anyone else experienced this? I am waiting to call the doctor because I am convinced it is not another ectopic, but still don't know? Is it just because the tube still needs to heal? Sorry this was soooo loooong....~A"
TRMT	Bright Red Bleedings 6 yrs after partial hysterectomy	I had a partial hysterectomy (only uterus removed) in 2005.

DISE	Hip Hip....no hooray...lol	Here goes...hopefully this forum provides me some support or at least ONE person that may be going through the same thing I am.I'm 34 years old and I feel like I have the body of an 80 year old. In 2007 I broke my left ankle and had to wear a walking boot for approx. 8 months. During that 8 months I started experiencing tremendous pain in my right hip. Originally it was diagnosed as trochanteric bursitis. I had a steroid injection and that didn't help the pain. I then had an MRI and it was determined that I had the beginnings of AVN in that hip which was more than likely caused by about 10 years of oral steroids for asthma when I was younger. Anywho...the pain continued and I endured multiple steroid injections, anti-inflam patches, creams, anti-inflam pills, TENS unit...you name it, i've tried it.Last January I lost my job and I make too much on unemployment to qualify for healthcare assistance (it's a great group to be in let me tell ya! lol) so I was unable to go to any docs for my hip and I decided I would just suffer with the pain until I could no longer stand it. During this time I also moved to another city....SOOOOO last month I could barely walk. The pain is in the right groin, the front of the hip, the buttock and when I lay down my entire leg aches. I decided to go to a new doc up here. I explained everything I had been through as far as treatment on the hip. Do you know what his suggestion was?? A FREAKIN INJECTION! lol. This one was to be done under x-ray though. His theory was that none of the other docs knew for sure if they hit the right spot because they weren't viewing it under x-ray. Soooo I had the painful injection two weeks ago and guess what. It didn't help a thing. I called the doc and I'm going back on Wednesday...I've had so many injections in the hip that I have a major crater there from fat atrophy.I know that was a long story...but has ANYONE experienced anything like this? It's more than bursitis.....Could the AVN be progressed to a point that bad enough to hurt that bad yet not be seen on x-ray? He mentioned that it may look like I have a labral tear on my x-ray...what is that and is it something to be treated because he mentioned it like it was nothing. I'm so frustrated.Thanks for listening!
DEMO	Why am I spotting before my period? Please help!	Hi everyone. I'm really hoping you can give me some advice here and share your personal experiences. I'm 29 years old. I've been off oral contraceptives for two years.The last year I've been experiencing brown spotting before my period for about a week although last month it was two days before my period. It's not a lot but enough to wear a pantyliner as it does stain my panties and it's thick not watery (sorry TMI!). It does come along with some VERY mild cramping and bloating. I also seem to have more gas too (sorry again TMI!).I am so worried that something is wrong with me and am scared to go to the doctor. I'm frightened that I have a polyp or fibroid or something. I'm also scared I could have problems getting pregnant or staying pregnant. I have myself all worked up over this.I have normal periods other than the spotting. When I do have my period, I don't have an abnormal amount of bleeding and my cramps aren't totally painful. I bleed for the usual five days. Never had an abnormal pap. Oh, and the last two months my boobs have been sore pretty much all month long. They get extremely painful around ovulation time though. The sore boobs all month long is kind of a new symptom. Last month, I thought I was pregnant because of the sore boobs but I wasn't. Has anyone else experienced these symptoms and gotten a diagnosis?

PREG	Quick sharp pains in ovary area after IVF?	I had my day 3 retrieval on Friday, 5/21 and ever since Wed 5/26 have been off and on experiencing quick, sharp pains in/near one ovary or the other when I stand up quickly or cough, sneeze, or blow my nose. I know my IVF team said if I am pregnant, I might feel the same full/bloated feeling I had while on stims leading up to retrieval, but this is nothing like that. It's very quick and sharp and almost makes me cry out. Anyone else experience this? Is it a good/bad/neutral sign? I still have 4 days until beta.

A typical day for me involves two slim-fast meals and one turkey wrap with an apple for lunch.cardiovascular exercise is painful for me--I usually go into a coughing fit that can last for hours after stopping, even from only a few minutes of stressing myself. Nevertheless, I try to run up and down stairs for at least 5 minutes before breakfast every day, and spend between 10-15 minutes a day doing sit-ups, divided between morning and evening.I have a 9-5 job that is mostly sedentary, though often involves me being on my feet. Weekends I try to spend my extra time doing something active, but it's getting harder to afford it, so I'm looking at getting a weekend job.I have stuck with this plan for a month. A month ago, I weighed 250 lbs -- 2 lbs less than I do now.I have been trying to lose weight for years, and have tried all of the usual approaches, except for low-carb, because I can't afford the things I need to meet those dietary requirements. Even resorting to starving myself has only served to slow my weight-gain. The most I have ever lost was 3 lbs, by not eating at all for 3 days, which I quickly gained back as soon as I started eating again.At this point it is becoming a serious health hazard for me, since I can't afford to provide my own medical insurance, and my physique is starting to depress me. I need new ideas for ways to lose weight--at least 70 lbs--and keep it off."

GOAL	Left eyelid swells overnight, eye remains open	I've had this recurring problem for over 20 years, when I got a glass chip in my eye.    Chip was flushed out but never found.    Since, I have occasionally woken in the middle of the night searing pain in my eye and tears streaming.    This only happened occasionally, but now happens every night if I don't put ointment in my eye.Triggers seemed to be smoky atmospheres, dehydration (flared up in high altitude).    I've been treated on occasion for infections due to my eye being open, but after several doctors, the conclusion is that I have scarring on my cornea and should get my eye treated by using an older procedure to reshape the surface.Could the chip still be lodged in the eyelid?    If I scarred last time my cornea was disturbed, don't I really run a risk this time?Thanks!

TRMT	Safety of Magnesium Supplementation	I'm 60 a -year old female who has suffered from severe leg and foot cramps at night as well as constipation for years.    I recently started taking an OTC Magnesium Oxide supplement, 400 mg per day and it has helped me with those two issues (I don't have to take Miralax anymore).    But I read recently that you should not take Magnesium supplements if you have a slow heartrate which I have.    I've exercised my entire life (and continue to do so), so my resting heartrate is 54 bpm.    Is it safe to continue taking the supplements?    I would hate to give them up as they'ved helped me so much.    Would it be better if I took one pill every other day?    Thank you.
DISE	Aching under breast bone where heart is located	Over the last several years there were a few times that I noticed if I took a deep breath it would hurt very bad under the breast bone area of my chest were my heart is located.

SOCL	STD or what? Help!	One week ago, i began having slight discomfort in my testicles - upon inspection, i also noticed small, flat, red spots on the upper shaft of my penis.    the next day, the pain in my testicles was nearly unbearable, but the spots had faded.    i went to the doctor and he checked me over, gave me a RX for cipro and lortab, and sent me home, saying it was probably a general infection.    over the course of the week, the pain in my testicles would come and go, along with some nausea and an overall sick feeling.    i also noticed that the skin on the upper shaft of my penis seems to be peeling just a little bit.    now, a week later, i have some mild stinging with urination every once in a while, and again have small, red spots on my penis, along with the ever-present testicle pain - no discharge, ever, though.    i plan to return to the doctor tomorrow, but can someone please help me out with this?background:    married for a while and i and my wife have remained faithful.    wife shows no signs.

DISE	When do you know it is time to get help?	I have a four year old daughter and she suffers from anxiety.    It started about a year ago when she started preschool and they had a fire drill.    The loud noise terrified her!    They have a fire drill once a month, and since that first one, she is almost uncontrollable when she knows there will be a drill.    Since then, she had developed a fear of candles.    She is afraid they will make a fire alarm go off!    Recently she became fearful of balloons because they might pop and make a loud noise.    For a year I have told myself that this is a phase that will pass, but it seems to be getting worse.    She can't even go to a child's birthday party because she will have a panic attack (she shakes, cries, hits, does anything to get out of the situation). I just want her to be able to enjoy her childhood and not worry so much about things like that!    How do I know if it has gone too far?    My instincts tell me that this is not normal, but so many others tell me it is just a phase, and besides, I wouldn't want to medicate such a young child.    I really just don't know what to do anymore.    It breaks my heart to see her this way.    Any advice would be appreciated.

GOAL	visual field changes	my retina specialist has consistently said I have mild dry ARMD.    in June, 07, my visual field in the ARMD and glaucoma eye was near normal.    Two weeks ago, I had another visual field taken and was told the eye has worsened significantly.    The glaucoma specialist says it's probably the retina, based on her interpretation of the visual field data.I am seeing much worse in that eye, with a graying of the central vision.    I also have severe floaters which have been increasing over the last six months.    Each time checked, I've been told no tears.    Floaters may have fooled me that there was no change in the central vision due to retina changes.Are such 'rapid' changes in visual field unusual?Is it possible for any other factor to be the main contributor to my dramatic vision change/loss in the left eye, other than worsening macula conditions?

It was for cleaning and one thing that was weird was, he put something in between my 2 front teeth and was like sawing in between them!    I didn't think anything of it, but a little while ago I noticed that my 2 front teeth had a gap!!!    I've always had straight teeth, and now there is a friggen gap in between them!    Now, it's not a large gap, but enough to get me mad at what happened.    I'm wondering if anyone knows of dentists who do something like this or what, but it's really making me mad.    Even one of my friends who I haven't seen in a while. told me ""wow, I never noticed you had a gap"".

FAML	7 yr. old girl with alot of energy!	I have a 7 yr. daughter, that I cannot seem to get through too.    I have asked her educators if she acts out in class and they have all replied no! The oly comlaint I get from her TEachers is that she rushes her work, and does not take pride in her work.     But, at home she is a nightmare.    she will not listen, follow directions, lives in a pig sty in her room until I go in and empty it, will just become very excited and not focus on anything.    Nothing matters to her, to use a positive reinforcement, negative can't even be considered ; it only gets worse.    she does not eat an excessive amout of sweets, maybe one small treat a day,every thing else is very well balanced. I would just love to find a way to make her hear me when she gets this way.    it is not every second, but some weeks it is more than others. Is this ADD? IS THIS JUST A LITTLE GIRL WHO LIKES TO BE VERY FREE SPIRITED?    what does one do?

PREG	Can Cetrotide help in follicle maturation?	Dear doctor,I have unexplained infertilty. I had 4 times hormone stimulated IUI. 2 times (75 IE Gonal F) which resulted in 1 mature follicle of 18 mm. Also 2 times(100 and 112,5 IE Puregon) without insemination, because of premature ovulation at 15 and 17 mm follicle (too small).My doctor says that if the follicles are too small and burst too early, they are of insufficient quality.Can Cetrotide prevent this too early ovulation? Can Cetrotide help to develop the follicle in growth/quality and prevent this? My doctor says that Cetrotide cannot prevent a bad quality follicle from early ovulation and if it does, the follicle is not mature and has bad quality. I would like to hear your comments on this topic.Isn't this what you do in IVF? Cetrotide to prevent early ovulation and let the follicles grow until they reach 18-20 mm and good quality? What do you think should be my next step?
DISE	Advice Needed	"Hi! I am 38 years old. I am 5'7 and weigh 123 lbs. I exercise everyday and I am a high school teacher. I have been suffering from the following symptoms for the past 3 years : burping constantly after eatting, feeling of solid food getting stuck in my throat, sensation of excessive mucous in my throat after eatting. I basically use a juicer, eat smoothies and very soft foods. I feel like I have a ""90 year old's"" diet!    I have been to ENT and 2 different Gastro dr's . I was told it was GERD and put on Nexium 2's a day for 8 months with no relief. Then, tried zengrid and prevacid with no relief. Had upper endoscopy with dialation that helped for a few months, then symptoms returned. The second gastro dr. seemed at a loss as to why nexium would not work and why his dialation during endoscopy did not work. I am now seeing a different gastro dr who will do a motility test next week. I am well educated and not ""imagining"" these symptoms. I even had an ENT tell me to just ""take a muscle relaxant"" to eat! This seems ridiculous, since I am able to eat soft foods and liquids.I am very frustrated that every doctor I see has a different opinion. Do you have any advice? All of the gastro doctors seem frustrated that Nexuim does not work. Have you had other patients with these symptoms? The only medication I take is .88 levoxyl for thyroid. Coincidentally, all of my issues stated 3 months after starting levoxyl. Every dr. I have been to said it is not related, but I would like your opinion. Thank you for your help!"
FAML	My 4 year old son is suffering - and so are we	My son (4 years old / 5 in Feb) has be exhibiting what I consider to be serious behavioural issues for the past 3 months.    My Mother moved in with us this year as a result of my separation from my husband (father of my son).    It has been a year of great changes and up until about June, very traumatic events involving our separation (father was in and out of jail / Mental Health hospitals plus restraining orders from both myself and his pre-school against my ex).    Adding the fact that my son went from going to a very good pre-school full time where he bonded strongly with his teacher to starting half day JK in a different school.This issues are that he doesn't sleep enough, goes to bed at 7:30pm and even though he stays in bed and usually doesn't get up in the middle of the night - he always has dark circles under his eyes and tells us that he lies awake in bed for a long time.    He has been hitting children at school (teacher says that it is never out of anger, more out of boredom) he has been throwing tantrums at home with myself and my Mom.    He says things like he doesn't want to live with us anymore and that he hates us and screams and cries emotionally when asked to do the simplest of things (put boots on, go to the bathroom, eat your vegetables etc..).    He is a very articulate and bright boy with an wide volabulary and advanced comprehensive skills according to his teachers and what we experience.    Until this year, he was always very calm and easy.    He never expresses that he wants to see his father and I do encourage him to talk about him and when he does it is always in a matter-of-fact way ie..that's Dad's book - Dad's really tall etc...    never in an emotional way.    He has started to lie aswell.    For instance if I ask him if he has gone to the bathroom or if he drew the picture or had help etc...I am very concerned.    My Mother has stated that if things don't improve soon that she will not be able to look after him anymore.    She cries almost everyday and so does he.    He expresses great regret after he says those things to us and he can be extremely caring and affectionate and has a great sense of humour.Do you feel that this is a result of his age or a build up of all that has happened this year?    I am afraid to add even more change in his life by introducing a specialist if this is simply normal.How can I and my Mom help him?Concerned MomChrisCam
GOAL	Reasonable cost for teeth preparation for crowns, and temporary crowns placed on	The total cost of the work including permanent crowns with insurance would have been around 11000. However i decided to change dentist at the phase when i was in temporary crowns placed on but i wasn't satisfied with the work done. The dentist refunded me 4000, so he basically charged me 7000 for the work done until now,( filling down    8 upper teeth and placing a one piece temporary on them, no final crowns were fabricated, and received). The total labor time was around 4 hours. It's his cost reasonable?
FAML	I need help, and opinions.. boyfriend addicted to opiates.	"I've been in a relationship with my boyfriend for two years now. We've lived together for one. I knew he had struggled with addition previously when he was younger, but thought he was staying clean and sober. About 8-9 months ago, he confided in me that he had relapsed and was back to snorting pills. I told him to go back to live with his aunt for a few days while deciding what I wanted to do. When he agreed to stay clean, I allowed him to come home. From what I've seen, he's been clean.. but, while he was at work this evening he got an email from someone whom he'd asked if they had any oxy, heroin, or roxies. I confronted him VIA text message just expressing I was upset, thinking he had been doing good these past few months. We just moved into our second apartment after a rough first year (financially) and I just wonder if this is all a waste...Of course I love the kid, but hell, I'm nineteen years old. There's a million boys out there for me.. I even started talking to one on and off.. I just don't know if staying with him is worth it. Do opiate addicts ever get clean? I know my best friend has watched her father struggle since her birth twenty years ago... Every time I suggest he get professional help he argues with me, saying it doesn't do anything, or he can't afford it. I know it's mostly him not admitting he's that bad.. or wanting to quit maybe, but if I could get him to go, is there any hope?I have this idea in my head that once he grows up a little, he'll be better.. Or if he could get a steady, well paying job and maybe start college, he'd be busy enough.. Maybe it's all wishful thinking, I don't know. I'm so tired of wondering ""what if"" constantly. My family hates him for his habits, so I can't talk to them about it..Any comments, concerns, ideas, or opinions are greatly appreciated."

FAML	Odd behavior for 2 year old	Hi I have 2 year old(birthday in April) triplets. One of the triplets is very hyper and active and loud. She also does a strange thing with her diaper and other cotton like items. It started about 4 or 5 months ago with blankets. She picks at the blanket until she gets a bit of the cotton off and then drags the cotton across her lips for a minute or so and then tosses the cotton. Now she is doing it with parts of the outside of her diaper. She gets a pretty good amount of cotton off the side stretchy part of the diapers and drags them across her lips and then throws them in her hair. SHe has 2 to 3 bunches of cotton in her hair at any time. I try and correct her about not doing this action but by the end of the day there are 100 bunches of cotton all over the rug. We try to keep her dressed, but she takes off her clothes, or she'd just find a blanket and use that for the little bits of cotton. Like I said she is very active and probably gets more time outs than her triplet sisters but I am concerned with this behavior is a bit odd.

GOAL	Photophobia, Eye Pain, Trails (palinopsia), Dark Spots, shimmering, flashes	"Open to all ideas!39/f. Sudden onset in November, 2006...started seeing trails behind moving objects. By Feb., I developed severe photophobia with eye pain...which invariably led to a killer ""brain freeze"" headache above my brow. A couple months later, I noticed several dark spots and squiggles in my vision. They've been multiplying to the point they're really distracting in day to day life. By summer, I developed occasional flashes and streaks in my peripheral vision. All of the above mentioned complaints have continued 24/7 to this day. This week, I noticed the air seems electrified, or slightly shimmering...as if my sight is just TOO good. I feel like time is running out for my sight...or my sanity (I think I'm allergic to pain)....which led me to mad-crazed googling...which eventually led me here.About my medical history....I've been checked by a neurologist, ophtalmologist, neuro-ophtalmologist, and back to a neurologist. All findings are normal including eye exam (20/20), eeg, and mri. Diagnosed with an autoimmune thyroid disease (post-partum thyroiditis and/or Hashimotos depending on which dr you ask) and, what I would describe as a life long ""blah...whatever....I'm exhausted and just want to sleep"" disorder. The latest neurologist thinks I have a degenerative autoimmune eye disease that effects the retina. And...she's pretty sure I have lyme disease. Another dr. is sure it's lead poisoning and/or lyme. Many new Dr. appts in the next couple of weeks with many more test results."

SOCL	my mom died in april of this year.	When she told me she was sick, I thought she was exaggerating. She had just attended my sons 4th birthday party March 9th. She seemed fine then. Then she was at my house telling me she knew something was wrong. She told me about her life insurance policy. I thought she had a bad flue and she was gonna be ok. All of the doctors she saw told her she was just having back spasms. She went to the emergency room on March 21. They gave her an MRI, and found cancer. She had stage 4 lung cancer. It had spread to her spine, endocrine system, and her brain. The doctors told us that there was nothing they could do. She was put on radiation therapy for ten days. I took her every day, she was rapidly loosing her mind. The time the doctors gave at first was up to 6 months, then it was no more than 4 months. Then they told us she could go any time. She died April 16. I miss her, my son misses her. My question is how can I help my 4 1/2 year old son cope with her loss. He keeps telling me he misses her, and asking when we will see her again. I tell him not for a long time. I also am having a hard time dealing with the fact that I wasn't at her bedside when she died, I couldn't make myself go there. I knew she was going to die but I didn't go to her. I feel so selfish, why couldn't I be with my mom when she left. I will always regret that.
SOCL	Connecticut survivors to attend school in neighboring town	"http://news.yahoo.com/connecticut-survivors-attend-school-neighboring-town-155145415.htmlNEWTOWN, Connecticut (Reuters) - The children who survived Friday's shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School will not have to return to the scene of the massacre when school reopens later this week and instead will attend classes in a neighboring Connecticut town, Newtown school officials said on Sunday.It remains unclear when the 436 surviving students at Sandy Hook will return to class, but when they do it will be in an unused school about 7 miles to the south in Monroe, Newtown School Superintendent Janet Robinson said.""The Town of Monroe has graciously offered their Chalk Hill School,"" Robinson said in a statement. ""This facility, which is currently not being used, is in excellent condition and will accommodate all of the Sandy Hill School students and staff.""It is located just across the border from Newtown and should be ready for occupancy in just a few days.""All seven of Newtown's public schools, which serve more than 5,100 students, as well as private schools in the district, will be closed on Monday, school officials said late on Saturday.Officials were scrambling for ways to accommodate surviving students from what had been the town's largest elementary school, serving 5- to 10-year-olds in kindergarten through fourth grade. The public school remains an active crime scene.A Newtown police officer expressed doubt the school could ever be used again.""At this time it's too early to say. But I would find it very difficult for them to do that. Certainly that's one of the things they're going to have to look into,"" Lieutenant George Sinko of the Newtown police said at a news conference on Sunday."
DISE	Dizzyness sometimes?	So I've been having these 'dizzy' spells for quite a long time - but I'm not sure if it qualifies as dizzyness without any neurological symptoms or loss of coordination/balance? I went to an ear doctor who went through it with me, and he said I had no symptoms - and he's right, because I DIDN'T HAVE THE SYMPTOMS WHEN HE CHECKED... It's only sometimes.Today, I was driving my car, and I had to reverse a lot.. This made me feel a bit dizzy and sick, so I waited for a while before continuing to drive.. As long as it went forwards, there wasn't really a problem. Now, it's afternoon, and it's almost 10 hours ago I drove. At lunch I felt slightly better, but it's back now.. Dizzyness from driving alone would NOT last that long?Thanks!

FAML	MRI shows PVL, What questions should we ask our nuerolgist?  Appt. is in 4 days.	"We recently returned home 3 weeks ago from adopting our 2nd child from Guatemala,    He is 11 mos. old.    Our frist child we had biologically.    We have know about our son since he was 6 weeks old.    We received pictures, videos and monthly medical reports on our son.    ----everyone reported he was ""normal"", and on track.I am a special education teacher, but have no medical background.    To make a long story short, we noticed MANY things that were 'off' about our son while we were in Guatemala.    We knew being an international adoption that he would not be up to par on all his delvep. milestones.    However, we noticed that he never seems to use his right hand or right leg very much.    Also, when I changed his diaper, he would bring his legs in and they seemed tight.    He also arches his back a bit he you are holding him, especially if he does not want to be held.We are finally back in the stated.    The MRI shows a brain insult, and that his symtoms(symptoms)are most consistant with that of PVL.We have a neurologost appt. on Friday.    What should we ask him?    Our son can sit indpendantly, likes to ""walk"" in a a walker and ""jump"" in a jumper.    If you hold his hands, he will walk across the room.    He also babbles incesently.Any advice you could provide would be greatly appreicated.Thank you,Mschuetze"

GOAL	Constant tooth pain for over 2 years	Hi, I just have a question for anyone who might have the same thing that I have been going through for the past 2 years. Starting in 2005 I have had a root canal on tooth #3 and a rootcanal on tooth #2..I aIso had re rootcanal treatment done on tooth #3 twice and twice I have had surgery on the root ..now tooth #3 and tooth #2 are filed down very low and they have    put a crown together on them...I am still in pain, I am sensitive to hot (not cold) and by the dentist touching the gum area..(everything looks fine on the xrays they say) I have been to 3 different dentists since all of this has started..and no one can figure out why I am still having pain?...I was at the dentist again last week..and he doesn't even know what to do? he did say maybe I could have the tooth removed(#3) but can't give me a straight answer if this will stop the pain? I could try and have some kind of gum surgery that might take a long time to heal and it still won't make the pain go away and my insurance will not cover it, because my gums are healthy? it would cost me somewhere between 650.00 or more?? I am at a lost as to should I just have the tooth removed..but I am also scared that if they do that it will not make the pain go away, and because I had all this work done already with the root being removed, I will probably have a hard time getting an implant in place?? sorry so long..just wonderign if anyone else has ever expierenced this before? or does anyone have any good suggestions..I am desperate for this pain to go away. Thanks.

The bridge was removed and the dentist stated in order to save this tooth, which already had a root canel, it would be necessary for the dental surgeon to build this tooth up, since the decay is at or below the gum line, before putting on a new crown.    How is the tooth built up?    My other option is dental implants.

TRMT	Question regarding repairing lip damage	About 6 or so years ago I got what seemed like a cold sore on my lip. The problem is that it never went away. Basically it is similar to a cold sore (no scabs, etc. just looks like a bump on my lip). My research on the internet has mostly revealed surgery related to making lips bigger, etc. but I just want to remove this. I am going to see a plastic surgeon soon, but I was wondering if, in general, things like this are correctable?I saw a doctor a few years ago who said that since it is not serious, and is cosmetic, I would have    to see a plastic surgeon.Regards

FAML	New Addition	Dear Doc,I recently had a baby 6 weeks ago and my 2 year old has reacted most likely the way she should, but I am out of ways to discipline her or how to react to the situaton. She is a very stubborn little girl with a big personality which on a daily basis is very hard to deal with, I cant leave the baby at all, I have to basically build a wall between him and his sister otherise she will hit him or fiercely scratch his face or head and if we are not careful he will cop an object thrown at him. She will take his dummy away and throw it. When I do let her have a hold or touch him she will be gentle at first, then she will attack him. I know it is all about jealousy but how do you cope and discipline this behavior as well all the normal 2 year old behavior. We have tried so many methods of discipline from ignoring the behavior, naughty corner, time out and talking to her but nothing is working and she keeps on doing it which is putting alot of pressure on the family. Please help us.
DISE	Cardiac vicious cycle?	"I am 63 yrs. Have had angina/MI/angioplasty with 3 stents RCA 1996. I had angina/angio with no stents in 1998, 2000, 2002. In 2004 another round of angina,MI, 2 more stents in RCA. I now have ""full metal jacket"" in that artery. I have had no problems since. My concern at this moment is that I have had 6 bouts of angina in the last 5 evenings. It is the exact same as all the others, shortness of breath when lay down on left side, achy burning on inside of upper left arm and neck, jaw. It last until I take a nitro. So far 1 pill has worked. My blood pressure which has been low (110/70 or less) since a ovarian tumor surgery 4/2007, is now back up to 180/90 or higher and at the time of the angina it was 198/103but as soon as Nitro worked, it was down to 135/75. I am on Toprol xl (for high heart rate of 120 or above), venazepril, diuretic, fenofibrate, simvastatin, aspirin, Lantus, glipizide. I have lost 30 lbs since Nov. Lipids are down to normal limits now and I have been walking for my back and sugar. Why if I am on all the right meds and done all the right things is this starting again. What is the point? I don't want to go to the ER again, nor do I want to go through the whole procedure again.The only nights without symptoms are the ones where I prop up in bed for 1-2hr before lying down.

FAML	6year old needs a doctor	My grandson is in need of a Doctor and we dont know what kind exactly. He has been to every kind you can mention and yet no one can diagnose him.    He was sexutally abused by the parent and it was not able to be proven. My daughter has done everything in her power to help her boy. She has lost jobs because she is the one running him to the Doctors offices, therapist office and general doctors appointments. She is the one up at night during feedings, nightmares, bed wetting and puking. The family of this man could afford a great attorney who got him every other weekend with the two boys. The younger boy he basically ignors but favors the son that we know he molested. My grandson came out and said it to a social worker in explicit detail and they took the father out of the picture until their lawyer came into it. We have gone through thousands of dollars for our grandboys trying to get my daughter to move back to our state of Michigan. We have been in and out of court and found the judge gave the father more time with the boys. We also found out the judge went to school with the father. Plus the Gaurdian Ad Lidem , who is our grandsons lawyer in    a court of law new the grandparents on the fathers side too and recommended that they get the children more. We have been living a nightmare for several years now. Now my grandson is going to kindergarten at the school the judge told my daughter to bring him to and he is causing some trouble. Not some , alot. He is in detention every day and not allowed out in the playground. He is disruptive in class and hurts children. He is crying out so much and yet no one is helping him other than my daughter.They have already meet with the whole group of school and parents to try and work this out. The school says its a long process and not sure if they are labeling him as special ed or not. Meanwhile my grandson sits alone every day at lunch time and if he has hurt someone at school has to come home and be punished at home for hurting a young friend during shcool . He does not seem to be to bothered by it though. That scares me a lot. Someone in above forum mentioned Charles Manson and that is what I was thinking. Where do we go? No one is doing anything for her. He has been with the same therapist for a year and is being tested to ADHD but this is not the answer. Is there any Doctor anywhere in this country who could check him over and help. Perhaps it is the fact that he has been abused. Then why isnt anyone doing anything about it?    Help us please come to some answer. I am willing to fly my grandson anywhere    we can if someone can help him.

TRMT	Symptons related or just coincidence	I am 53 yrs. old and post-menopausal for 5 years. I am scheduled for an abdominal hysterectomy in July.    I've been told I have a 9 cm uterine fibroid and my uterus is about twice the size it should be.    One ovary was visualized with an abdominal ultra sound, the other could not be visualized by abdominal ultra sound or transvaginally.    If I ever had fibroid(s) previously, I was not aware of them.    The worst menopausal symptoms I've experienced were during peri-menopause.    I had night sweats for a good five or six years and still have them once in a while, but it's certainly bearable.Following is what confuses me.    As part of a routine physical, I had labs drawn on a Saturday.    On Monday, I started feeling really crummy, almost like I was coming down with the flu.    By Tuesday and Wednesday, I was really aching and chilly.    By late Wednesday, I had severe pelvic pain and pressure.    The Dr.'s office called on Wednesday with the lab results.    I remarked that I was glad they were calling, because something had to be wrong with me, I felt really awful.    They said I had gout!    My uric acid was high which indicated I had gout.    I didn't have symptoms one usually thinks of with gout - no hot joints, just achy all over.    She suggested that since I had never suffered from gout before, sometimes the first flare-up can be scattered.    She also said I was dehydrated.    I explained the symptoms I was experiencing, telling the person it felt like my uterus was going to fall out.    I told her if I hadn't had a period for 5 years, I would swear I was suffering from menstrual cramps.    She said, dehydration could contribute to some of my pain, advised me to over hydrate and if I didn't feel better the next day, to call and come in.I went to the Dr's. (GP) office on Thursday.    Urinalysis revealed red blood cells in my urine.    The NP asked if I could be constipated.    (Sorry, this is really TMI.) I felt I was having a bowel problem, since I hadn't had a bowel movement for a couple of days.    I'm someone who regularly has at least 2 BMs a day, so, after 2 days, I felt this could be a problem.    They x-rayed my abdomen and the NP said there didn't appear to be enough there to cause the pain I was experiencing.    She performed a pelvic exam.    She said my uterus was enlarged.    I need to explain here, my past two PAP smears have been difficult, if not impossible to accomplish.    In 2007, my gyne missed obtaining any cervical cells to test and didn't even know it until the test came back with nothing to test.    The gyne explained since I was post-menopausal and not sexually active, my uterus had shriveled (my words, not his) and moved up very high.    Apparently, my cervix is very small also.    I had two children by C-section. The gyne dilated my cervix and was able to acquire a smear.    The next year, 2008, the gyne NP could not get a sample and I opted to try Vagifem inserts and they were able to complete the PAP smear in January, 2009.    They had to use an extra-long, very thin speculum to perform the PAP smears both times. I explain all this because from January to April, my shriveled uterus was now twice the size it should be.The GP NP referred me for the abdominal and transvaginal ultra sounds which led me to check in with my gynecologist.    He said I certainly had pathology that warranted a hysterectomy, but he was agreeable to waiting a few months, doing the ultra sounds again, and see where we go from there.    I asked if there was any way he could biopsy the fibroid to make a decision.    He said no, there wasn't anyway to do that except with hysterectomy.    He said he truly doubted there was any malignancy.    He advised that usually, with uterine cancer, post-menopause, there would be bleeding.    He explained, and I know from my own research, fibroids are seldom malignant (1%?), but, he had no explanation as to how or why a fibroid would develop and/or grow so large, post-menopausal.    So, I've opted for the hysterectomy.I know this has gone on way too long, and I apologize.    The internet can be a very good place to perform research, but it also can be a very scary place if you search too much.    I've run onto web sites decrying unnecessary hysterectomies.    The complications they cite are really scary, e.g., nothing to support the bladder and/or bowel after removing the uterus, something call a rectocele, pelvic floor problems.    I don't want to suffer bladder or bowel leakage if it turns out I could have waited to have the hysterectomy.    But, on the other hand, I've also read that sometimes, a malignancy is discovered within a fibroid that would have existed for years before creating problems.    I don't want to wait 6 months or a year only to eventually have the surgery and be told it is malignant after all and if only I had done something sooner...I'd appreciate any thoughts or ideas anyone can contribute.    Were all these issues related or just coincidental?    I feel okay now.    Ever so often, I feel slight pain in my lower abdomen, a kind of pinching pain.    I will appreciate input from the group.Thanks,

DISE	Swollen Lymph Nodes	Hi,My daughter has an appointment at the Hospital on Monday and I am wondering what to expect.    She is going because her lymph nodes have been swollen for 7 months in her head and neck.    Last Wednesday I took her in to the doctor and he said now all her lymph nodes are swollen...not only in the head adn neck, but armpits, groin and abdomen.    She has also started having nose bleeds which started around the same time the lymph nodes were noticed.    What are some less serious things that this could be?    Do the lymph nodes usually stay swollen for this long with a virus?    Any input?    Thanks

TRMT	kidney	Assume one is in the very earliest stages of kidney disease with a GFR of 85 while >90 is considered normal.    What kind of dietary ristrictions should be followed?    At what point is it necessary to reduce dietary phoshorus, potassium and salt?    What levels should they be reduced to?    Is this for the purpose of maintaining normal blood levels of such or is it to reduce stress on the kidneys?    What is the amount of protein restriction?    Also, are magnesium supplements harmful to the kidneys?    Or is it just that someone with impaired kidneys may run into a problem.    Are there any vitamins and minerals, if so at what dose?

SOCL	Russians take fresh samples from Antarctica's hidden Lake Vostok	"http://cosmiclog.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/01/11/16471991-russians-take-fresh-samples-from-antarcticas-hidden-lake-vostok?lite&ocid=msnhp&pos=4By Alan BoyleRussian researchers say they have brought up fresh samples of clear ice from Antarctica's Lake Vostok, a huge reservoir of freshwater more than 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) beneath the surface.    Lake Vostok could contain water and perhaps living organisms that have been sitting undisturbed in the deep dark for up to 20 million years. The drilling operation also could set a precedent for far more ambitious efforts to find life beneath the ice of the Jovian moon Europa or the Saturnian moon Enceladus.Because of the potential for contamination, scientists have been taking extreme care at Lake Vostok, which is situated 800 miles (1,300 kilometers) east of the South Pole. A year ago, the Russian drilling team reached the lake and brought up water samples. Some of the water was even served to Vladimir Putin, who was then Russia's prime minister and is now the country's president. But it wasn't clear whether those samples were actually from the lake or from the glacier above the lake, the Russian news service RIA Novosti reported.This year's drilling operation is aimed at bringing up samples that can be linked more definitively to the lake itself.""The first core of transparent lake ice, 2 meters long, was obtained on Jan. 10 at a depth of 3,406 meters,"" Russia's Arctic and Antarctic Research Institute said in a statement. ""Inside it was a vertical channel filled with white bubble-rich ice.""    The institute said that drilling operations would be extended another 24 meters with the existing cables, and that new cables were being delivered to the Vostok research station. The core samples were to be subjected to chemical and biological analysis.Lake Vostok is about 160 miles (250 kilometers) long and 30 miles (50 kilometers) wide, making it the largest of Antarctica's nearly 400 subglacial lakes. Last year's drilling operation drew up samples from a depth of 12,366 feet (2.34 miles, or 3,769 meters). In October, Russian team members reported finding no native life within those samples. They said the only microbes they detected were traced to contaminants from the drilling oil.The lake could serve as a laboratory for studying what Antarctica's climate and ecosystem was like millions of years ago. It may contain creatures unlike any that exist today. And as ambitious as all that sounds, the Vostok operation is seen as a mere warmup for future sampling missions to Europa, Enceladus and perhaps other icy moons in the solar system.Planetary scientists see ample evidence that liquid water exists on those worlds, miles beneath the icy surface, and astrobiologists have theorized that internal heat may provide enough energy for organisms living within those hidden oceans."

SOCL	cankersore or coldsore?	"soo i posted a question about herpes before Let me explain my story. back in october i got tested for everything in my blood it was just a checkup it wasn't because i was sexually active or anthing. Anyways the results    came out negative for hsv1 and hsv2. i' just realized this now because a took i really good look at my results back then i didnt care because i wasnt in a relationship or ever been sexually active or anything so i knew i didn't have an std lol. Probably within a month later i made out with this guy    the only guy i kissed within the month after my test    probably for lik 10 minutes. lol i'm 19 btw. Anyways i was under alot of stress that    week also i couldn't sleep wasn't eating right i was crying alot i was really depressed / stressed out that week i felt me getting sick because of all my stress.Within a week later i started to develope something inside my mouth not my lips it was weird i felt a slight tingling and then i looked INSIDE MY MOUTH i saw a small shallow ulcer it was inside my mouth it wasn't on my gums or the roof of my mouth it was like on the really soft part of    my mouth like when you pull down ur lip that soft part. idk why but the first thing that came to my mind was a COLDSORE    i showed my mom and she told me ""thats not a cold sore idk what that is but it's not a coldsore"" Considering i got tested for hsv1 and it came back negative a month prior to this you would think it's not a coldsore but i was ignorant and had no idea what hsv1 was. It hurt when i talked and ate it was unbearable and i had lip swelling so i went to the doctor and told her i think this a coldsore! lol I just told her she looked at it quickly and agreed. My point is i feel lik the doctor was wrong this happen over 7 months ago i started researching and i think what i had was a CANKER SORE. I Told my mom about it and she says she never thought it was a coldsore she felt the doctor was wrong. Canker sores i read can be triggered because of stress can cause lip swelling and appear in the mouth coldsores can appear inside the mouth also however (rarely) but even then it's usally on the gums,hard pallette or roof of the mouth. Mine was on the soft part of my mouth when you pull your lip down. I did have tingling but i read canker sores also can give you a tingling feeling before they start. I'm almost 100% sure it was a canker sore but you know the doctor said it was a coldsore. In my testing results i came out negative for the coldsore virus but then a month later i get a ""coldsore"" I feel like there's no sense in that. I mean i did make out with one guy after those tests but he had no sores or anything or his lips.However that's why i feel the    doctor can be    wrong. I did my research on coldsores and cankersore and from the description i gave you guys here i'm almost 100 percent sure it was a cankersore. If the doctor was wrong honestly i'm furious because she had me thinking i had oral herpes when i didn't but anyways can anyone put some input for me here i would like to get some opinions and help me i can't talk to my mom about this lol    btw The reason why i care so much is because i'm now in a serious relationship it's been 4 months just recently about a week ago i made him get tested so if we get sexually active i know he's clean. My boyfriend came out completley clean for everything including hsv1 and hsv2. ( he's the only guy i kissed after the cankersore or whatever it was lol )That's why i care so much. I'm pretty sure i'm hsv1 negative now but i    also just want input. Thankyouu =)"

FAML	Devestated to send daughter to daycare	I have been very fortunate to work from home and care for my daughter since she was born, she is now turning 3.    Sometimes I wonder how we survived this long financially, but we did and we are grateful and feel very blessed.    We have reached a breaking point, and out of financial necesity I need to return to work outside of the home full-time.While from a very large family, I do not have family or friends that can care for Alexis while I go to work.    This time in my life, has by far been the most emotional time for me.    My concerns?    Many to say the least.    I am afraid my relationship will change with Alexis.    She is so attached to me and I feel like I am abandoning her.    How will she possible understand going from being with me twelve hours a day to just a few at night?    How will these daycares ever really understand her and be able to work through the battles that I face with her day-to-day.    I am so sad and so worried this transition is going to be horrible for both of us.In Alexis's defense, she loves to play!    And when I say play, I mean all day.    Often beyond what I can offer energy wise.    Maybe being around kids all day will be good for her.    Maybe me getting out of the house will be good for me.    Has anyone gone through this that can offer me some advice.    Thanks:)

Less than 24 hours later I have developed a slight burning sensationat the tip of my penis. It does not hurt or burn when I urinate.

As I figure, its probably a urinary tract infection from when we attemped to have anal sex.

PREG	Miscarriage	A week ago I went in for my first OB exam. The doctors office told me that based on their calculations I was 13 weeks pregnant. Great news because I thought I was about 10 weeks. They asked me to come back the next day because they were not able to hear the heart beat using the doppler. They said not to worry that you usually can not hear it until about 11 weeks. Not worrying I went back the next day.Two vaginal ultrasounds confirmed that the baby did not have a heart beat. They said the baby stopped growing at 8 1/2 weeks. The doctor said I could either allow my body to shed the baby naturally, or I could have a D&C. I was hoping to let nature take it's course. So now I am fixated on the fact that the baby died 6 weeks ago, and is still inside my body. Accepting the news has been so sad and difficult. I still feel pregnant. Has anyone else experienced this before? I would have thought that the baby would have passed my body by now. I have had no bleeding at all.

DEMO	back ache and stomach cramp	hi, for about a week now ive been suffering from lower back ache...its a dull ache across my lower back and comes and goes. i also have been getting more infrequent stomach cramps, im wondering if there might be a link? my doctor did a test of my urine and there is no sort of urinary infection..but i really cant tell if the two symptoms are linked or serperate? i am due to start my period in about a week so i was wondering if perhaps that had something to do with it...other than that i cant think of any explanation for the stomach cramp other than that i was quite constipated about a week ago..which caused stomach pain...but i took something which you disolve in water to relieve constipation and it seems to be ok now. in terms of the back pain, i do exercise frequently but havnt really been doing anything different..and i do stand up alot at work and wear quite flat shoes...so perhaps this could be causing my back pain? as you can see im quite confused..and my symptoms are quite vague so my doctor suspected it was some kind of muscle strain after checking all my movement, which was fine and just told me to take pain killers..but im wondering if you could be able to see something else? thanks i would really appreciate a second opinion..and sorry for the long comment!

He has a very high energy level    - loves to run around in the park and make friends.He is also non-cooperative, I have to tell him to do something several times, he is very willful and defiant.    I signed him up for pee-wee soccer and I am the assistant coach and he does not want to participate.    When we talk about it, he says he loves it and wants to continue.    He does the same thing at school - they have yoga and he does not participate at all.    Yet he loves pee-wee baseball, swimming and piano.Just want to make sure that he is ok and on track and I have nothing to worry about.    I just have a normal four year old.    I am doing the proper thing by keeping him in soccer and exposing him to different sports and music.Thank you!
PREG	help	I'm on the pill, and normally i start taking sugar pills on a wednesday and get my period that friday until sunday. I had sex on the 17th of June and we used a condom and he pulled out. On Sunday July 1st, i experienced some bleeding which was like a light period. That bleeding continued on monday, tuesday, and wednesday. On that wednesday i took my sugar pills and the bleeding stopped until that saturday and sunday. It was light enough to fill up a panty liner each day. It lasted for 5 days total, and it still looked like a light period. Would you think this is implantation bleeding or a messed up period because of stress, or an increase in working out?

FAML	Children who could Potential be Threats to Society	My son is 6 years old and things that he do are not in the norm.    One of the things he do is he still weight on himself whether its in when he is sleep or playing with someone and they are wrestling.    The most unsanitary thing he do is he will stand and pass a bowel movement on himself and than try to hind it by wiping it off of him with paper or wet wipes.    He started doing this at the age of 4 where he would put the feces all over the walk or on his toys.    He is a very smart boy but he has anger problems and doing this is like the last straw for me.    I want to get him some help before he grows into a man and do things I dont even want to think about.    People tell me dont put him on any drugs just discipline him in other ways.    I have tried that and he do well for a while and then the minute he is left alone in a bedroom he do these nasty things.    I'm lost how to I help my son before this turns into something horrible.Very concerned mom HELP!

DISE	Antiseptic wipes	Hi folks,I had an encounter last week and have been paranoid ever since.     I panic a lot and my mind keeps telling me that the skin is breaking down there whereas I check it and everything looks ok. Hence I decided to buy alcohol based antiseptic wipes.    I use it down there to check for any ulcers / cuts / bumps, since if there are any, I will get a burning feeling and kind of know that there is something wrongI use this technique to kind of figure out IF I have any breakouts.    I don't have the best eyesight, so rely on this technique.If I did have sores / symptoms of HSV2, and if I did apply alcohol laden wipes, it would burn right ?Please excuse my lack of medical knowledge, just grabbing at straws before my Week 3 test.

TRMT	involuntary weight loss	"I usually weigh around 190 lbs. 5'10"". 33 yrs old. I workout hard. Very in shape. The last 5-6 months, I've lost around 15-20 lbs. But it seem's like weight I don't want to lose. My diet hasn't really changed. I'm also, feeling a little weaker. And I want to gain it back. The only thing I can think of... is, that I have been under alot of stress. Worrying too much. Thinking too much. All that kind of stuff. Is it possible this could just all be stress related? Or are there any types of health problems (off the top of your head) that could cause this. I know this probably sounds vain. But I'm really noticing loss of thickness around my shoulder's, chest, back, and other muscular areas. I'm just wondering what is wrong. I'm not doing any ""cardio"", in hopes to help. I even mix up my routine, to trick my muscles. I take a multi vitamin, magnesium, vitamin E, omega 3, and try to keep up my protein intake. Anything you can tell me, or suggest, would be a great help at this point. I want to gain my weight back. I'm getting very concerned. Thank you."

DEMO	Hair Loss	Hi, I'm 14 years old and when I was about 11 years old I started to pull my own hair out of my scalp, but I'm not sure how I started doing it but It just became a bad habit. By the time I was 12 I had a load of bald patches dotted around my head and my hair was extremley thin. I was really self conscious about my hair and started to eat more, my mum told me that If I didn't stop soon she would take me the doctors because my hair was in such a bad state. By the time I was about 13 years old I really wanted to try and stop and loose some weight, but It was more difficult that I thought, but gradually the habit started to fade, every now and then I still pull some of my hair out, but I'm much better now and have lost a bit of weight too. I was wondering If anyone knows any reasoning of why I may have started pulling my hair out? And maybe some remedies to try and grow and thicken my hair again the way It used to be?Thanks for any answers x
TRMT	finding a doctor for bio-identical hormones.	Hi,Glad I found this forum.     I would up in the emergency at the end of September with severe abdominal pain.    I hadn't been to a gynecologist since my last child was born 9 years ago.     Well    they found a large mass in my abdomen.    They wouldn't operate right away as they were waiting for tumor markers to come back to see if they were elevated.    They were, so i was transferred out of that hospital to another one to a doctor that specialized with ovarian cancer.So they took everything, both ovaries, they said one was a size of a softball and it was bleeding.    The other one didn't look good, so they took that one too.     Pathology came back, NO cancer, praise to God.It's been 5 weeks, and i want to get on some hormones.From what i have read, estrogen plays a vital role in a woman's health.    Bones, heart disease, skin, hair, eyes, the list just goes on.    I am 41 years old, and i feel i have just catapulted myself into old age by 10 years.I just went to the doctors today for my post surgery appt, they said everything looked good.     They do not recommend hormone therapy unless I would be experiencing severe symptoms.I want to get on bio-identical hormones.    I feel the medical community frowns upon these, but how do I go about finding a doctor?    I assume I would need blood tests to check my hormone levels, and I would need a prescription to take to a compounding pharmacy.     I have asked 2 doctors, both gynecologists about them, and they both said they would only prescribe the synthetic ones if need be.How do i locate someone to lead me down the path of bio-identicals.I am located in PA.thank you,

PREG	product of conception, not knowing you're pregnant	I had some thoughts that I might be pregnant because of few weeks of break in contraception but as i started to take my pill again, I had no symptoms of pregnancy. I come on my period and on the first bleed i think I've might passed down something like product of conception. But there was no strong pain stomach. Just a normal pain in stomach and in back. What is the tissue which I've passsed down? Could it be a poroduct of conception or something else and what it could be ? I'm really confused about it but can't stop thinking what it was...
PREG	BLEEDING BEFORE PERIOD...implantation?  PLEASE HELP	I posted this in the wrong forum earlier.    I had sex on day 6.    I ovulated on day 10.    I had pink and brown spotting on day 20.    On day 21 and 22, more brown spotting only when I wiped.    Today is day 23 and there is more dark brown spotting when I use the bathroom.    It is stringy and thick, almost stretchy and mucus- like.    I have no cramps or any symptoms that I would normally get before my period.    My cycles are usually around 26 days and I usually spot one day with the full on bleeding the next day.    I did an EPT this morning which came back negative.    I know that the chances of me being pregnant are slim, but this bleeding is abnormal for me.    Can anyone please describe implantation bleeding in detail?    how long it lasts, how much there should be, the consistency of the blood, any accompanying symptoms... Thank You

GOAL	Crystalens HD- new postop got the wiggles	I am two weeks postop with a Crystalens HD in my left eye.    My distance vision is great, but I am not yet accommodating to intermediate and near.    I am not worried about this yet.    What is going on that has me puzzled is that every time I change what I am looking at I get a quick 'wiggle' which I can see in my left eye.    By this I mean I can actually see the iris move in the mirror, looks like a quick shake of a jelly.    Sadly I am seeing the regular optha and not the surgeon for my postop appointments, and it was clear this doc had never seen such a thing.    Also sadly this doc didn't bother to talk to the surgeon to see what may have gone on during the operation, even forgot which lens I had.I am guessing the new lens is _trying_ to accommodate, but some viscous stuff was put in the front part which won't go thru the iris opening easily and thus the wiggle, as the eye tries and gives up on the lens movement since it meets resistance.    Has anyone seen this wiggle?
GOAL	Rezoom lens post op. problems?	"I had a rezoom lens surgery for cataract in my left eye two weeks ago. I am 54 years old in good health. I had atropine drops for three days to dialate my eye prior to surgery. It took over a 8 days for my eye dialation to normalize. My surgeion told me that everything went well but my vision is not acceptable. Many posts say that they can see distance, intermediate, and close fine right after surgery.    At this time on the eye chart I can read 20/20 but I am looking through a fog. It is like there is a ghost like image with a sharper edge, almost like a double image. Interediate vision is problematic. In the opthalolgist office I can read but it is REALLY BLURRY however with the ability to read at almost 20/30.    Does this make sense.    The halos at night are not complely circular and not as intense with both eyes as if I cover my right eye. I seems that I can not focus my lens eye except at far distance in daylight like driving. If I had to depend on my new lens eye only I would not be able to read or do anything short of far away vision which IS more clear but not a bright a picture as my non lens eye. Trying to use a computer screen or see intermediate or read even large print especially under floresent lighting is Poor even though the Opthalogist keeps putting me off by saying "" You are doing fine, you are healing, you can read the eye chart better than before the surgery. You are over critical you must have patience""    Am I nuts or the fact that I am concerned about the poor quality of my vision and want to know what I am experiencing and what It may be is it too much to ask. The letters reading seem to all mush together but have some sharpness.... Does that make sense.    Does my brain have to catch up because it seems that except for FAR vision I can not really focus at all. What do I ask, What could be going on or is this the norm.    Help"
FAML	child's behavior	I'm wondering if my 4 1/2 year old daughter might be ADHD or just defiant to her parents. She can go to other people;s houses and play and listen but when she is home she is a totally different child. She doesn't listen to simple tasks like picking up toys or sit down at the table, everytime we are on the phone she screams, somebody comes to the door she goes running to it, she can't sit and watch a half hour tv show. when we take her out she has a fit out in public and starts screaming. She makes a scene everytime we go out. I don't know what to do. We have a 9 month old son as well and I was thinking some of the problem was a new person in the house but her behavior doesn't improve. Does this sound like it could be ADHD or just an overly hyperactive child. She is going to be starting school this year and I'm concerned about how she is going to act...Any suggestions..It's gotten to where we miss out on doing alot of things because she refuses to listen and has a tantrum when we go out.
DEMO	Reoccuring BV and discomfort on right labia?	Since about the end of August/September 2008 I began having issues with reoccuring BV after treating a yeast infection in late July. Since then, I have had several reoccuring infections. I became sexually active in November [i was not sexually active prior] and that seemed to trigger another infection. Around thanksgiving my gyn prescribed Clindesse vaginal cream and the infection seemed to subside for about a week and then it returned. I wasn't able to go back to the doctor for a follow up because I was away at college. In January I went back to the gyn and I took a dose of metronidazole. There was no reduction in symptoms and I'm still having issues with discharge, itching, burning during urination and just general irritation. Recently, my right labia has been causing me discomfort while, walking, exercising or just laying down. Does this discomfort have anything to do with BV?I don't have a history of any other STD/STIs, I do have a history of vaginal eczema and I'm currently using the Ortho Evra patch for contraception. I haven't had sex since december and I'm 19 years old. I've been trying to regularly eat pro-biotic yogurt but nothing seems to help. Does anyone have any insight as to how to get rid of BV once and for all? I really don't want to return to the doctor AGAIN, but I suppose I'll have to if this doesn't clear up soon.
SOCL	Does this end or continue?	"Where to begin?    Well, my husband and I have been seperated since April, and we have yet to get back together..the seperation was his idea.    We have 2 children ages 7 and 2 and since our seperation the kids have been juggled from one house to another..he lives with his parents and I live with my dad.    We seperated for many reasons, but the main 2 reasons we seperated was finances and the way that he treated me compared to his family.    My husband is 2 years younger than I am, I'm 27 and he's 25.    He has always been a very family oriented person, and I don't mean with me and my kids, but I'm talking about with his mom, dad and sisters.    He constanly would put them before me and never really considered how I felt about it.    A few months after we seperated, we started trying to work things out and things seemed to have been going a lot better for us, he was working on his issues and I was working on mine.    Over the past few months I have been really pushing for us to get a house together and become a family again so that our kids can have stability, and he agrees with me, tells me that he loves me and that he wants our marriage to work, but then once the conversation takes place that specific day, nothing ever gets mentioned about it again.    About a month ago, my mother passed away at the age of 46 unexpectedly, very tragic on me and my family.    My husband was semi-supportive for a few days after it happened, but once the funeral was over with he went back to his ""normal"" life and never really seemed to care about what I was and still am going through.    My husband is 25, lives with his parents, doesn't have to pay any bills and just works odd jobs here and there to have money.    I keep pushing him to get a job so that we can potentialy buy a house in the near future, but it's like I am talking to a brick wall.    I have been so sad and depressed about what has happened with my mother, and the fact that my husband is not being very supportive makes me feel very lonely.    He goes days at a time without even speaking to me, and then calls me or let me rephrase that, he TEXTS me and acts like everything is great.    I have recently started counseling to help me deal with not only my mothers death but with my marriage issues.    I am at a point to where I can't take much more, and I really don't know what to do anymore.    My husband tells me that he loves me, but he really hasn't shown me over the past few months that he gives a rats a** about me.    I don't want my kids to continue in the chaos of our seperation, but I really don't know what to do anymore.    I truly do love him, but I feel like I am the only one who really cares. Please any advice would help."

FAML	restless sleep	My son is nearing 12 months and is a very restless sleeper. He wakes up almost every hour. Always has. Sometimes he falls back to sleep by himself with the help of his pacifier, other times bottle or cuddling. My husband works full time during the day, and I work 3 days a week, midnight shift. He visits grandma at night sometimes also, once or twice a week. I can't figure out if it's his unpredictable schedule that is keeping him from restful sleep, or if something else is wrong with him. My mother-in-law seems to think he has pinworm; however he is a very happy baby. In addition, Both my husband and my inlaws think he doesn't eat enough. He wets and poops an adequate amount. Are they just being paranoid, or should I be concerned?
SOCL	Help Me Let Go	"I am 26 and going through one of the hardest times in my life right now. Its a long story but please be patient and read it all. I desperately need your help.Last summer I was diagnosed with depression and anxiety. I was put on an anti depressant and an anti anxiety med as needed. Shortly after I met the man of my dreams. He's military and is the most amazing man. He has been through depression himself and understood what i was going through. Understood the dark place i had been when i had tried to commit suicide. He was encouraging and supportive.The past 8 months he has been my best friend and my boyfriend. He has been there through thick and thin, he has helped me put the pieces of my life back together and find a purpose again. He made me feel complete. Like i could finally be myself and be loved. Like i could finally be completely honest with someone and not be judged or rejected. He said all the I love yous. He said that he was In love with me. He's favorite quip was ""its ok, we'll get through this, im keeping you, remember?""About two months ago i felt so good i thought i could get off the anti depressants. He wasn't keen on the idea, but said ""well get through it, and if it doesn't work, we'll just get you back on them ok. Im here - Im not going anywhere!"". About a month after getting off the anti depressant He got orders to be deployed. I feel apart. I went completely needy and paranoid that no matter how much he said he loved me, he really didnt and that he was sure to find someone else over seas. etc. I didnt really reazlie until the past couple of days that being off the medication is probably what made me act that way. Usually i would be strong for him and support himTwo days before he was to fly out, he got word that he wasn't going. The deployment had been canceled. I thought he would want to crawl into his little man cave and sulk and be mad at the world for a few days. But he didn't he just wanted to be with me. It was totally unexpected. Some how my irritability and snappiness got worse over the past month. I was just mean and hateful and up one min then down. I snapped back at him more than i ever have and i didnt see it until he pointed out two weeks ago and i feel like the scum of the earth.When he pointed it out, he also said that he needed time and space to think. I was a wreck. I went into full ""what did i do wrong?"" mode. I couldn't not give him time or space like he asked for, which is wrong of me i know. I had to ask why, what happened, what was going on, what did i do, yadda yadda yadda. The more questions i asked, the worse his answers got. They went from ""I just need time to see if this is the direction i want to keep going in"" to ""You're smothering me and i feel married, when im not!"" to ""there is no me anymore, theres just us and i have no freedoms!"".Monday of this week he decided that our relationship was over. That he loved me, but wasnt IN love with me anymore. Now i know he's been working 17 hour shifts at work, i know he's had to deal with a failed PT and numerous other stupid stunts his troops have done as well as a plane crash on base. I know my added neediness and pestering didn't help. I know that coming off my drugs was the main cause of my reactions, because normally i would never be that type of girl. I know that part is all my fault.Im currently getting back on my medications because i now understand that sometimes a chemical imbalance like i have is not curable, its an ongoing battle. The past few daus he's flip between "" i hate this, i dont know how to do this break up, i care about you so much"" to "" it makes no difference any more if i see you again, there's nothing left to rekindle."".You have to understand. This is a very very good man. He has is weaknesses sure, he has his moments of course. but he does not make empty promises, he does not mess with a person's heart or emotions unless he knows what he is doing. He teaches his troop members that a girls heart is special, you treat her with respect and honor, and you dont play with her heart, unless you love her and you mean it. For the past year he has said that he has intentions with me, intentions to keep me, he's told his friends this, his family this, he's done everything humaly possible outside of proposing to let me know Im safe in his harms and in his heart.So what happened? I know i played my part in breaking him down. And i am mortified at my actions. I know work played a part. I dont know what to do. HIs best friend tells me to hold on, to not give up, to just let him get have his space and work things out. That he doesn't realize what coming off the medication did to me.On my side - im back on my medication, it'll take a while to build up - sure, but im a mess. Im a wreck. I knew the second week of meeting this man that this was the man i had prayed for. Im not eating, the medication makes me want to sleep all the time. I feel so depressed and rejected by the love of my life that i've waited 26 years for. Im having SEVERE anxiety attacks.    I pray for understanding, for calm, for strength. I pray for help and guidance and for courage for him as he goes through whatever it is he's going through.He says it's over, but I know in the core of my being that this is the man i've waited my whole life for and i can't give up. I dont know how to let go of it. I dont know how to give it to God. But i know i have to if there is to be any resolve. Any relief for me and for him. I want to help him so so badly, but i'm not sure what to do. I keep praying the same things over and over and over and i know thats wrong too - i should have faith in my first prayer. BUt im not strong in my faith.Please help me. Please someone shed some light on what i should i do. What i should do for him, what i should do for me. I take full blame for my actions, but he's never given up on me and this is tearing me apart."
GOAL	Bands of light after cataract surgery	I had cataract surgery on my second eye yesterday.    Tonight I was out walking and noticed the full moon had a clear band of light like a laser beam, exactly the width of the moon, extending diagonally out from the moon down across the vegetation to my left and up across the clouds to my right.    I then noticed that street lights had the same band across them at the same diagonal angle.    I can tip my head and the angle changes accordingly.    The implanted lens in my other eye doesn't and never has done this.    I know something like this effect can be achieved by squinting at a light, but I can't get this to go away.    What's going on?    And will it go away?

DISE	How do you LIVE with MS?	I just joined this community today.    I was diagnosed with MS in April 2010.    My first symptoms showed up in January.    I woke up with my left side numb.    Got in to see the Dr. right away.I am on medication, but I have a difficult time keeping a good attitude.    I think I could figure things out if every day was the same!    However it is not.    It drives me CRAZY as I never know how each day will go.    Will I be tired?    Will my legs suddenly weigh 500 lbs each?    Will I have tremors?    etc.    I really want to know how you keep a positive and upbeat attitude.Thanks,Naomi

DEMO	Swollen lymph node?....groin?	HelloI wasn't sure which forum to post this in,however I'm hoping someone can answer my question.On Monday I woke up and noticed two long scratches on the left side of my groin/close to crease in my leg which I must have done in my sleep, I didn't think much of them.The following day I woke up and noticed that I had a swollen lump in the left side of my groin next to where the scratches are. I am guessing it is a swollen lymph node?....It is quite achy/sore. Would a small thing like scratches cause a lymph node to swell?I will admit that I am a bit of worrier, so I apologize if this question seems ridiculous. The lump feels firm/tender/sore/and moveable (I think). It also disappears when I lie down - when I was younger Ihad a hernia removed from next to my belly button (left side) could this be related?I have recently just got over a sinus infection,although in this case I am guessing that is irrelevent as sinuses are not located in    the groin.I'd be grateful for any feedback.

TRMT	Could I ever be able to have a child?	HiSeptember 02 2010 woild make it 2 years since I had a partial hysterectomy. (My womb was removed). I am 40 years old and without a child. Is there hope out there for me?In case you're comtemplating on having a hysterectomy, please do it as a last option and after you have had numerous opinions. I went in to had a fibriods removed but my uterus was taken to safe my life or so I was told. I would never had willingly had the surgery done.If you ask me, I don't feel normal. I have the emotional swings. Most important of all, I do not feel sensual and because of this I feel less then a woman.    I think I rather had die with my womb intact then have a hyterectomy. Enough of my rants and back to my question: Is there hope of me having a child?
DISE	Need advice	I am in the process of trying to get a diagnoses for this. I have had 2 previous surgeries for herniated disc. I have been on disabilty for 10 years now , with the dianosis of degererative disc disorder , scoliosis , ostioarthritis , restless leg syndome , IBS , have issues with cramps and muscles spasms, bladder control issues , a relentless throbbing in the base of my scull , blood pressure fluctuations , and now my PCP suspects fibromyalgia . But in doing my reasearch I came upon a site on the web about adhevise arachnoiditis. This seemes , to me at least , to be a much better fit for what I am experiencing. I was wondering if an MRI done at lowerfield strength magnet would be able to show this ? As I had one done just 2 months ago.
DISE	Migraine, 1 eye crossed, shingles..at 18 y/o? What?	Years ago, at age 19 I got a headache that would not go away...after two weeks of this I developed a rash on my back so I made a doctor appointment.    I was told I had shingles (a small band w/ no pain)...suprised my doctor by being the second youngest case he ever seen in his practice.    Was prescribed pain killers and scheduled MRI w/no dye.    MRI came back normal& was sent on my way. About a week later my left eye crossed in and freaked me out so I made another appt and stumped my PCP after being tested for tropical diseases, disorders and other blood tests so was referred to neurologist.    The neurologist did a series of tests and ordered another MRI but with dye. Again, normal--more pain killers and a eye patch.    I had regular trips to the neurologist and for about a month still suffered these migranes(migraines), & nausea (assuming due to the vision)-I did not get out of bed much..I thought this would be permanent.My neurologist prescribed meds for bells palsy as a last ditch effort to correct the problem before hed order a spinal tap.    After taking nearly all the meds my eye miraculously crossed back in normal and headaches went away,    My neurologist said I either had Meningitis that the MRI didnt detect or I suffered a small stroke (I was 18 and otherwise healthy).Fast forward a couple years and I made my yearly trip to America's Best Eyeglasses and contacts for my eye exam and fitting and she freaked out and ordered me to go to the ER b/c she said my optical nerves were swollen and I Could possibly go blind at any moment...so I went and was paired up with the Opthamologist on call and ordered to visit him at his office the next day because I could possibly have Multiple Sclerosis and he wanted to do several tests.    I did, I took what felt like a million tests to be told I have optic disc drusen.Also, at age 21 I developed PUPPPS during my pregnancy at 4 months pregnant (if that helps any) and I had a PDA ligation @ age 18 months.So now I sit here at age 24 and wonder if all this could be put together to some kind of disorder or am I prone to these rare conditions.    I am just entering nursing school and am learning to be my own advocate but feel like no doctor will listen to me long enough let alone research my medical history.I still suffer frequent headaches but not of migrane(migraine)magnitude and usually goes away with NaproxenDoes this sound normal and pure coincidence or am I onto something?    PLEASE HELP!
TRMT	Antibiotic or Healthy foods	I have been having re-occuring boils about once every 2 months. It comes, pops then goes away. I went to the doctor and he gave me an antibiotic to help kill off the bacteria that could be causing it. I have already taken one anti-biotic, and it says to take two every day for two weeks, but after researching, I don't want to use the anti-biotic anymore and would rather fight it naturally. I am big on tea (green, white, etc.) and try to eat healthy foods. I would go the natural way, but I'm now worried that since I took one pill, I am letting whatever bacteria there is build up a resistance to it. Should I try to fight it off naturally with nutrition, sleep, and exercise, or keep taking the antibiotic so the bacteria won't become resistant. Thanks!

TRMT	Clogged ears from rhinoplasty, response to Jane328	"Hello, I am posting this to reply to Jane328 to whom I cannot reply directly.I have the same problem as you, Jane,---clogged ears ever after a rhinoplasty, and doctors who cannot diagnose the cause of this suffering.I feel that my ears are clogged, essentially, because my nose is too small.I cannot get a proper volume of air in at once, creating a ""suction"" issue. I feel like I am breathing through cocktail straws.I feel this suction throws off my Eustachian tubes' ability to equalize internal pressures. Therefore, my ear drums are always a little retracted. Their retraction translates as a feeling of ""pressure"" and ""clogging.""I may not be expressing the nitty gritties of the technical issues involved correctly, but I believe the general expression that the unnatural pressures that have been created by having an extreme ""suction"" situation when breathing, or simply an unnaturally small nasal vestibule has created eustachian tube dysfunction to be correct.I would like to cotnact you, jane, to fund out what else we have in common. Did you have an infracture of your ascending process of maxillae? What tests have you had done?please contact mepequita.elenorita@ymail.comThere are two dots in my email, one after ""pequita"" and one after ""ymail."" Please contact me. Perhaps there is a light at the end of the tunnel for us!!!Anyone who has any insight into this problem please contact me or post here, in addition. thanksThis discussion is related toClooged ears after rhinoplasty."

FAML	Immature 7 year Old Girl	Hi    I have a soon to be 8 year old daughter who is causing me some concern.    She is excelling at school and the teachers say she is very clever, the problem however is that socially she is very immature.    She squeaks rather than talks and when she does talk its all baby language - this only occurs at home and never at school. She pretends on numerous occasions that she is an animal and slides around the house rather than walking.    She will never dress herself and has poor hygiene habits - forgetting to wipe herself and leaving toilet roll on the floor rather than flush it she also forgets to wash her hands on numerous occasions.    Overall she is a lovely clever girl but i am very worried that she is not making friends like she should and is regressing back to being a baby and this behaviour is very worrying.    She stays with her gran after school while we are out working and she is surrounded by her cousins varying in age from 1 year to 10 years old so its not as if she doesn't see more grown up children.    I would add that she has a little brother of 3 who is already leaps and bounds ahead of her socially.    When we ask her to do things she can look at you blankly as if she really hasn't understood what you have said - its so confusing when her school work is excellent and progress reports at school are outstanding.    Help!

GOAL	Thyroid Issues and Weight Loss???	"While your thyroid conditions can make it more challenging to lose weight, losing weight is entirely possible and an undertaking that is best done among the caring and nurturing support of friends.    These friendships, like you have and continue to develop in this community, can provide the support and motivation to move forward together as a group to meet your goals.    For the most part, successfully losing weight for the long term, means we need to address what we eat, why we eat, what emotions may be involved and our activity levels.After being morbidly obese at 330 lbs, I began a natural weight loss program of selecting healthy foods ... lean meats, whole grains, fresh fruits & vegetables and low-fat dairy.    My attitude changed to one of ""belief"" and ""can do"" and physically I began to move.Please know that YOU CAN DO THIS!!!!     We begin by taking baby steps and making small changes.    Start by setting small goals of 3 lbs, 5 lbs and no more than 10 lbs, reach that goal and celebrate it!!!    Those successes are our building blocks that prove to us that we can do this and it provides the motivation and confidence to continue on your journey.    It doesn't come off overnight, but it is not supposed to.    It didn't go on that way either.I never could have thought of my total goal of 176 lbs, however, by setting and reaching a 3 lb goal, celebrating, setting a 5 lb goal, celebrating and never giving up, I have now lost a total of 152 lbs!Would absolutely love to have all who are interested join us in the Weight Loss & Dieting Community.    We're a fairly small group but we are growing and wonderful things are happening.    There is a wealth of knowledge in the members and we have some exciting things coming very soon!!!    You won't want to miss out on them!!!    Why not join us there, get your weight trackers in place and give us the unique privilege to share your journey with you????    We promise to be kind, caring, considerate and provide a positive and accepting atmosphere as we all move forward together.    There is strength in numbers and, as members of the thyroid community, perhaps we can work to make some special posts and provide information that speaks directly to your concerns.I'm starting a discussion for the thyroid members who wish to join.    Please come and introduce yourselves.    We truly hope you'll give us the honor of your presence!!!Great BIGGGGG Supportive Hugggssss!!!    Ranae"
TRMT	Possible Hysterectomu for me?  ughh	Hello,,, On February 18th I had an endometerial ablation done.    It seemed as if I was progressing and getting better.The purpose of the ablation was to correct my irregular cycle.    I was having extremely long periods.    Sometimes a month long.    But the periods were never heavy, so I was not aniemic.    I have had all the testing to rule out cancer.    That is not an issue.On    March 8th I started bleeding heavily.    The next day on the 9th, my husband rushed me to the ER, I was flooding everything and passing huge clots.    My Dr came to the ER,,, after a carefull exam. It was decided that I was to start hormone therapy.I took 2 back to back prescriptions of hormones.    Did not stop my bleeding,, it did stop the pain I've had with the constant cramping.    But the hormones made me extremely moody.Ok,,, so I'm still bleeding, and still having severe cramps.    I've become a couch potato.    It seems as if anytime I do anything other than walking around the house,, I bleed and cramp.    I'm typically not a couch potato type of person.Now,,, hysterectomy has been suggested.    And I have an appoitment in April for this.    I dont know what to do,, about ready to pull my hair out.    Been bleeding since Christmas Eve.Any insight from anyone would be greatly appreciated !

FAML	URGENT	Dear Doc,My son is almost 5 years now.Recently have seen lot of changes in him . His first year in Kindergarden was okay but this year from sept. when his term started he has problems he completely dislikes the teacher . he has become so moody that few days even he doesnot write a word & few days he is okay. Never greets his teacher, don't want to talk to her even hides things from me. He never tells what teacher has taught . He has developed habit of pricking nose & quite often puts his hand inside the trousers . He feels insulted if i tell him that what he is doing is wrong just don't want to talk.He was not like this before so much social that everybody used to love him now he don't like to mix with anybody. Just don't want anybody around. don't want to speak to his friends also & never fights with anybody if his friend snatches his thing instead he starts crying. Please it's very urgent . This way he is becoming a more of introvert child. Need to solve his problem .RegardsManisha
SOCL	Burning Labia	Hello,I am 29 years old, have not had children and have had on and off issues with my labia feeling as though it is on fire, the skin itself is so sensitive to touch even the softest cotton underwear against my skin seems to get inflamed even more so.    When I have gone to doctors for this they run test after test for yeast, bacteria, UTI, etc., and everything always comes back 'normal'.    Sometimes I've been put on an antibiotic or sometimes not.    No one has ever been able to tell me what the problem is.    I don't drink soda, I don't use any perfumed anything to wash with, I have tried not shaving or shaving, I wear cotton underwear, do not wear tight clothes, make sure to dry off entirely before dressing, wash regularly after sex or other physical activity.    I eat yogurt regularly and have also started taking probiotics (which I understand takes a while to start working).I do not have odors or discharge or itching with this - everything I have studied focuses more on other symptoms such as these.Is there anyone else who has had similar symptoms?    I have been tested and all is negative.    This has flared up whether or not I'm sexually active.    Help!    Any insight is much appreciated!Thanks!
FAML	Daughters unusual actions	"for a few years now my daughter (age 9) has done some things that have alarmed me.    a few years ago I found a ""pouting doll"" (the ones that stand in the corner) that she played with - she had dug out the mouth and private areas of the doll.    I dont' think she did anything with them just bore it out.    Then she has a picture/story bible that i noticed all of the girls eyes and mouths were shaded in in pencil, nothing else was drawn or colored just that.    Then just recently in her school agenda she did the same thing to a girl on one of the pages.    This behavior really disturbes me as I fear she may have some issues.    If anything really traumatic happens she doesn't talk about it much, and if she does its like it's no big deal. Please let me know if I should take her to a therapist, and maybe suggest one near by."

DISE	I need help.. Ther's something wrong with me..	I am a 16 year old female, and for the past few months, I've been having odd symptyoms...About ten months ago, I got these bumps in the very back of my throat. When I went to the doctor, he said they were swollen lymph nodes, and to expect the to go away within a few weeks. However, I still have them, and now I'm beginning to get white spots on them.Around a month ago, I began getting these wierd fevers.. I'll have a normal temperature, but the all of a sudden, I will develop a really high fever. It would get higher and higher until I broke a sweat, and then it would quickly go away. This happens in less than five minutes, and it's been getting more frequent.I've also been getting abnormally thirsty. I feel like I ALWAYS need to be drinking, even when my stomach feels like it's about to explode. It's gotten to the point where my mom, who's a nurse, had to tell me to quit drinking water because I've been consuming it in unhealthy amounts. But I have this insatiable thirst, and if I don't drink, it feels like I can't breathe and I get dizzy and too hot.I'm definitely not pregnant or diabetic, and I eat normally.

TRMT	Fat Injections	"I was born with a bilateral cleft lip.    They were repaired long ago, but I am not satisfied with my lip; it is very thin and flat.    I am considering fat injections, but I am concerned that my lip may not respond to the procedure like a ""normal lip"" would.    Is there any information on adults with repaired cleft lips having fat injections and what the outcomes are?"
DISE	Should My daughter have a scan?	My daughter is hypothyroid (we just found out) and EXTREMELY fatigued all the time. I've been reading about a lot of people having their thyroid scanned. The tests for thyroidglobulin antibodies came back at a staggering 415 and the thyroid peroxidase antibodies 883. Her t4 was 11.7. I don't want the docs to miss anything and they have ordered synthroid for her (still in insurance approval process) but I was wondering if I should ask for any other tests. Her bloodwork was covered very well and she had a lipid panel which came back kind of high. Should I ask for a scan on her thyroid? I want to be as thorough as possible.
FAML	My 7 year old son just started thinking my wife and or I will leave him	My 7 year old son just started thinking my wife and or I will leave him. If we drop him off at Sunday school he doesn't want to go because he thinks we'll not pick him up. His aunt and nephew asked him to go shopping and buy a toy which typically he would love but did not want to leave mom and dad. My wife and I went to diner and grandpa watched him which had been done several times before with no issue has now turned into him crying and not wanting us to leave and wanting to know when we'll be back. How can I reassure him and fix this? he turns on the tears not a grab leg type of worry just crying.    we have tried to reassure him this would never happen.

TRMT	How to prep for a Hysterectomy??	Hello Ladies,I am considered very high risk for Ovarian Cancer (family history), so my doctors have recommended a hysterectomy. They actually didn't have to recommend it, I was going to ask for it, if I had to!    I am 42 years old with no real signs of menopause.    My oncologist said I could wait a bit for the surgery if I wanted to get a bit closer to menopause to try to shorten the possible time on hormone supplements (if needed).    That discussion was about 8 months ago.    I am leaning towards getting the surgery this summer.    I am concerned about going into menopause, possible weight gain, emotional changes, and risks with hormone supplements......    However, I'm more concerned about cancer!    I do not smoke, I am not over weight (I could stand to lose a little weight ;-)))) and am in good health.    I would appreciate any advise or recommendations you have about hormone therapy concerns and any info you can share to prepare me for the hysterectomy.    I have no idea how long recovery would be.    Thanks Much!

This may be some of the problem part she has always been a very strong minded individual and likes to assert herself where ever possible.

I know we cant have it perfect both at home and in the classroom but there has to be an easier way than living in a battle field.    She is a very bright child and I have to admit has a maturity which seems beyond her years when she sais certain things.Please Help!

SOCL	Tired of being Sick can anyone help?	I am 31 years old I have iron and folic acid deficient anemia, along with that I have extreme fatigue to the point I could sleep 15 or more hours continuosly, with that comes with the loss of sex drive. I have had a headache for 1 month it stopped hurting for about 4 hours after the er gave me an IV with Torridol. I also have left upper abdominal burning and pain, I have not been able to function normally for about a month and have no idea what to do next. They have completed blood work and so far the only thing that came back was anemia. The er completed a ct scan of my head and they said it was normal, They have prescribed percocet to me for the head ache which is not helping by the way. I am not one of the people who like the feeling of being drugged I would prefer someone find out what is wrong and help fix me then drug me. Does anyone have any idea what this may be?    I have not told my dr about the pain because when I went for all of the other symptoms I was not having that pain. My mother told me 2 days ago that her grandmother passed away from leukemia so that has me worried as well. About 6 years ago I had my gallbladder removed so Im almost certain it is nothing to do with that.

FAML	8 year old waking up terrified and having racing thoughts	"My eight year old daughter has been waking up terrified for the past month.    It has always been out of a deep sleep about an hour after I put her down.    When she wakes, she runs around the house asking for 'help'.    When I ask her to describe what is happening, she says there are bright ""lines"" flashing around in her head.    Her heart beats fast and it takes me at least a half an hour to calm her down, usually by flipping the TV on.    Sometimes it happens more than once a night.    There is no concrete dream she can remember causing this, and often when she snaps out of things, she can't remember what happened or how she got into my bed."
TRMT	Feeling Nauseous After Eating	For the past ten months I have been experiencing nausea ranging from minor to very intense. Not after all meals, but at least once or twice a day after I eat. I kept a food journal in the earlier stages but after I saw no reoccurring pattern between what I was eating I gave up. Sometimes the nausea actually causes me to vomit after eating. I have also experienced symptoms of diarrhea multiple times a day. I have even noticed that I am not able to fully digest some foods, including lettuce, carrots, and noodles. The first time I saw my health care professional she thought it might be a reaction to the birth control pills I was one. She suggested I go off birth control to see if it helped, and I did for four months. This did not help at all. I went to see her again recently and she recommended calling a gastrointestinal specialist. I am wondering if anyone knows what this could be as it has become a little worrisome that it has persisted this long without getting better.

PREG	9 week old won't nap!	so heres some historybritton slept like an angel the first couple weeks home from the hospital. (mostly in her cuddle-u pillow like a boppy)then my mil came to visit and she was held a lot. sometimes to sleep. so for a few weeks i just held her til she was dozing off then put her in her bed. she would always sleep about 1.5-2 hrs. be up for an hour, then back down for a nap. then 2 weeks ago my sister in law came to visit and britton would get very overtired and wouldnt go to sleep so my sil would rock her to sleep. and she doesnt like sleeping in her pillow, or to be swaddled most of the time. so for 2 weeks ive been dealing with an overtired baby. she constantly wanted to nurse to sleep too so i had to break that habit because she would wake up after 30min. i gave her pacifiers for about a week but now she wont sleep without one and wakes up after 30min too because she cant find it. so i took it away 3 days ago and everything went downhill from there. the only time she sleeps for 2-3 hours is when its at night. daddy gives her baths at night and then she eats and goes to sleep. i always make sure shes awake when i put her down for bed time. she wakes 2 times at night to eat. usually 3-4 hours apart. (sleeps from 10-12 hours a night) so for naps she wakes up after 30min and i go in there and shes still exhausted so i try to get her to go back to sleep. but basically the wole cycle starts over again and she goes for my breast or looks for a paci. ive tried letting her cry but she will go for 15min. i try to calm her while shes in the crib. doesnt work so i rock her and she may or may not calm down.    wait until shes dozing off and stop rocking her. if she stays calm i try to lay her down. she screams bloody murder. i dont know what else to do. ive tried so hard to get her to stay asleep but im not going to give her a paci again because then i'll need to go in there every 30min. she will only fall asleep when shes exhausted any advice? im losing my mind and sick of hearing a crying baby. should i just give her the paci back since she wakes up after 30mn anyways?

As I have been to urgent care centers, and they have all said that the lumps don't look cancerous, and every time they just test me for strep, which always comes back negative, as well as my dentist. Although he did say that some of them could be caused by my improved brushing habits.What I was wondering, is could a lot of this be caused by my chronic infections that I get, like ear infections and tonsillitis. As I have very narrow ear canals. About the only thing that scares me is that lump under my tonsil that is pushing up on it.

DEMO	Young and Scared	Okay, so I'm 15 and a virgin. A day or two before the incident(which I will include later), my boyfriend of 6 months fingered me. After he fingered me, I noticed some light bleeding usually with my discharge. we thought the bleeding could be from my cherry popping. Before we started dating, me and my boyfriend agreed that we would not have sex at all. A couple days after he fingered me, I was still bleeding, and it was the day before my period. That same day me and my boyfriend were making out, and we got caught up in the mood. Long story short, his penis ended up touching my vagina. It did not go in at all, we both decided it was a bad idea, we just made contact. My boyfriend had not cummed yet, and he said he wiped his penis in case of precum. The next day, I believe I started my period because the bleeding was heavy (which is usual for my period) and my period has been normal and has been occurring since Wednesday and I'm writing this on Saturday. I do take birth control to help regulate my period. Can I be pregnant? Is the blood from popping your cherry fertile? Please help as soon as you read this (if you really know what you're talking about). I'm young and scared. I need    help.

SOCL	Lobbyists Who Profit From Senate Dysfunction Fight Filibuster Reform	Both Democratic and Republican senators have protected contributors with filibusters. (Reuters/Jonathan Ernst.)As momentum builds to reform the horrendously broken rules of the Senate, a cadre of Washington D.C. politicos are fighting back, arguing that the filibuster in its current form must be preserved.Last week, Steven Duffield, in an opinion column for The Washington Examiner, pleaded for the status quo, claiming Ã¢ € œSenate liberals want to gutÃ¢ €  the filibuster, which he called a Ã¢ € œlong-standing protection for minorities.Ã¢ €  Duffield, bylined simply as Ã¢ € œvice president for policy at Crossroads GPS,Ã¢ €  didnÃ¢ € ™t point to any examples of filibusters protecting the rights of minorities or marginalized groups. He listed other complaints, like the charge that rules reform will allow the Senate to Ã¢ € œrubber stampÃ¢ €  ObamaÃ¢ € ™s nominees to the Supreme Court.In reality, the proposed reforms do not affect appointments to the Supreme Court. And a more comprehensive reading of the filibusterÃ¢ € ™s history would show that when it comes to civil rights for oppressed minority groups, the filibuster has actually served as a great obstacle for justice.Maybe Duffield is alarmed about rules reformÃ¢ € ”which would limit anonymous holds, allow for a Ã¢ € œtalking filibusterÃ¢ €  and expedite deliberations for some nomineesÃ¢ € ”for another reason: his pocketbook.Two years ago, I took a screen shot and saved a tidbit from DuffieldÃ¢ € ™s now-deleted consulting website. DuffieldÃ¢ € ™s firm, still lobbying and called Endgame Strategies, was quite candid in itÃ¢ € ™s pitch to potential corporate clients to use Ã¢ € œbackbench Senate RepublicansÃ¢ €  to block legislation (emphasis added):Managing Holds and Filibusters. Your organization has an interest in a bill that has proven controversial and you require advocacy before those legislatorsÃ¢ € ”often backbench Senate RepublicansÃ¢ € ”who may exercise their prerogatives to delay or obstruct. Endgame Strategies will give you new ways to manage your interests in a legislative environment that gives great power to individual senators.Duffield, a former Senate aide to Arizona Republican Jon Kyl, literally sold filibusters, anonymous holds and the other forms of obstruction. In 2011, he reported at least $230,000 in lobbying fees. Current rules allow a senator to secretly block any legislation or nominee and then, without actually performing a talking filibuster, require a three-fifths majority voteÃ¢ € ”twiceÃ¢ € ”to proceed eventually with a regular majority vote, a process ripe for abuse by well-connected political operators of both parties.IÃ¢ € ™ve detailed before how lobbyists, even agents for foreign governments, have secured Republican filibusters at a shocking rate. The cottage industry around monetizing filibusters has grown rapidly since ObamaÃ¢ € ™s first election. From 2009 to 2010, there were more filibusters filed than during the 1950s through 1960s combined, as The NationÃ¢ € ™s Katrina vanden Heuvel observed.The interesting dynamic for me is, how money in politics has incentivized this contraction of democratic governance. Here are just a few examples of how powerful industries have usurped the normal gears of government, and used Senate obstruction to push policies that punish ordinary Americans and the environment:Ã¢ € ¢ Senator David Vitter (R-LA) placed holds on Obama EPA nominees to delay scientific assessments on the health risks of formaldehyde, which is produced by some of his largest campaign contributors.Ã¢ € ¢ According to a new report from Public Campaign Action Fund, Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has collected a hundreds of thousands in funds from the same industries he has protected with filibusters, particularly from oil companies and the finance sector. McConnell has led filibusters to protect oil subsidies, to block efforts to mitigate the mortgage crisis, and against campaign disclosure reforms.Ã¢ € ¢ Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL) placed a Ã¢ € œblanket holdÃ¢ €  on every Obama nominee to force the administration to accept a Northrop Grumman contract to build a $35 billion refueling tanker in Mobile, Alabama. Northrop Grumman is a major Shelby donor.Ã¢ € ¢ Senator John McCain (R-AZ) blocked the nomination of one of ObamaÃ¢ € ™s most important Department of Labor nominees for months, which many believe led the US Chamber of Commerce to aggressively support McCain during a contentious primary with a Tea PartyÃ¢ € “backed candidate in 2010.Ã¢ € ¢ Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA), a close ally of the oil and gas industry, temporarily blocked ObamaÃ¢ € ™s nominee for the Office of Management and Budget to extract an administration promise to allow more oil drilling leases in the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe.Ã¢ € ¢ Senator Bob Corker (R-TN) filibustered the Federal Aviation Administration reauthorization bill in order to demand a policy that prevents FedEx drivers from unionizing. FedEx is CorkerÃ¢ € ™s third-highest campaign donor.At the nexus of all of this obstruction are lobbyists who are making a small fortune negotiating these tactics.Another politico complaining about changing the filibuster, Martin GoldÃ¢ € ”a lobbyist for Covington and Burling who represents Qualcomm, BP, Amazon.com, BAE Systems, the Principality of Liechtenstein, among othersÃ¢ € ”told InvestorÃ¢ € ™s Business Daily recently that rules reform is Ã¢ € œunprecedented and unwise.Ã¢ € GoldÃ¢ € ™s somber warning contrasts pretty sharply with the giddy language used to describe a government affairs seminar he led in 2011. The American League of Lobbyists promoted the event with the following language: Ã¢ € œCan you turn Congressional rules and procedures into a tactical advantage for achieving your policy goals? Absolutely!Ã¢ € The National Rifle Association is one of the most powerful lobbying groups in Washington. See how the organization helps the gun industry reap even greater profits following gun-violence tragedies.http://www.thenation.com/blog/172087/lobbyists-who-profit-senate-dysfunction-fight-filibuster-reform#

SOCL	Men accused of gang-raping girl, 11, due in court	Girl's friend reported seeing cell phone video of rape in abandoned trailerhttp://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43651904/ns/us_news-crime_and_courts/LIBERTY, Texas Ã¢ € ” More than a dozen men accused of taking part in a series of sexual assaults on an 11-year-old girl are expected in court Wednesday in a case that has divided and horrified their southeast Texas town.The 14 men, who along with five juvenile boys are facing charges, are scheduled to be in a state district courtroom in Liberty for status updates. The investigation began in December, after one of the girl's friends told a teacher he had seen a lurid cell phone video that showed the girl being raped in an abandoned trailer.Authorities say the girl was assaulted on at least five occasions, sometimes by as many as seven or eight young men or boys at a time, from mid-September to early December in Cleveland, a small city about 45 miles northeast of Houston. The suspects range in age from a middle-school student to a 27-year-old, and include two star athletes at the local high school as well as adults with criminal records.Most of the adult suspects face charges of aggravated sexual assault of a child, while four face a charge of continuous sexual abuse of a child. Most have pleaded not guilty and are free on bond, while one, 26-year-old Marcus Porchia, was charged after his arrest with sexually assaulting another girl in an unrelated case.Girl, family blamedThe case shined a sometimes unflattering spotlight on Cleveland after some in the town of about 9,000 residents suggested the girl was culpable in part for what happened, claiming she wore makeup and looked older. Some also accused her parents, immigrants from Mexico, of not watching her more closely. Those suggestions were sharply criticized by many Cleveland residents and by community and religious groups outside the city.Also complicating the case was a belief by many in the predominantly black neighborhood where several of the suspects live that the arrests were racially motivated. All of the suspects are black, while the girl is Hispanic.The girl, now 12, remains in foster care as her parents, who have health problems and moved out of Cleveland after receiving threatening phone calls, work with state child welfare authorities to get her back.A gag order is preventing those connected to the case from commenting.Authorities began investigating after the girl's friend told a teacher he had seen a video that had been passed around among classmates that showed the girl being attacked. Police determined it was recorded inside a mobile home on the city's northern outskirts.The girl told investigators she was raped Nov. 28, first at a house near the mobile home and then at the trailer. Indictments allege she also was assaulted in September, October and December.

The tear got healed but then I got a rash inside the foreskin and it's really really itchy and if I try to pull the skin back it hurts to much to even do that.

PREG	Clomid	My husband and I have tried to get pregnant for a year.    I have PCOS.    I've been on Metformin for 6 years and have a normal menstrual cycle so I assumed I was ovulating.    However in the last year I had never once gotten a smiley face when using a ovulation stick.    Also my BBT never really changed.    So my doctor prescribed 50 mg clomid which I started last month on day 3 (my cycle started December 1st.    I ended up seeing a change in my BBT around the 19th and on the 20th I finally got a smiley face.    However, here I am at month two and my second dose of clomid.    I realize it's only my second dose but after trying for a year my heart is just breaking.    We want a baby so badly.    My doctor says most likely I was the problem as I wasnt' ovulating however when do I have my spouse go in and get checked?    I guess I'm more so looking for someone in the same boat as me.

I don't remember the exact name - but it was described as blood getting between layers of a vein in part of my brain - causing it block. For the most part - I've pretty much recovered. The lingering effects are noticeable (only to me) in my speech and a very weird effect that I have a difficult time describing.I feel as if my head is being pulled to the right by some unknown source. This causes my neck to get tired and is very uncomfortable. I've described it to my neurologist and he said I'll just have to learn to deal with it. After 5 years of ""dealing with it"" - I'm wondering if there are any other options. I've tried deep massage therapy, and I'm thinking of trying accupunture. I have no vertigo - just a very weird sensation.Any help or suggestions would be appreciated."
SOCL	I need help regarding marriage + ex-inlaws	I seperated with my wife in mid november last year. I do not blame her for leaving me because for 1 reason or another I didn't fulfill my duties to her as a husband. We both admited our errors and we want to get back together as soon as we get little financialy stable. She is 23 and I am 28. We have a 20 month old baby.However, her family, where she lives now, found out about our plans and made some strict rules. They do not allow her to speak to me alone, not even regarding the baby. We used to talk up to 10 times a day and even went out but now she writes me a text message every day or 2.She admited that her family is opressing her but she cannot do nothing about it at the moment. In her culture, parents must be obeyed. However I see no reason my marriage should die and my son to grow with 1 parent only. I love her and she loves her but we cannot get back together immediately due to financial reasons. Her family has no right to do this.Going to police wouldn't help because my wife wouldn't admit the abuse, partly out of fear and partly because she loves them.I wander what can I do. My wife says to be patient and things will work out but I do not see it that way since her family doesn't even talk to me. I feel hopeless and helpless. My plan is to stick with our deal and save some money and get back together but Im worried if they convince her or brainwash her to forget me.If I tell them they should stop doing that then they might even make her stop talking to me completely.Any advices?PS. We didn't go through court, we made a deal regarding the baby and agreed to have it signed eventually.

DISE	Lingering Discomfort from Gallstone Surgery	"I had my gallbladder removed end of Nov 08, by laparoscopy. 14 weeks later, my right ribcage still aches if I sit too long or work too hard, and the most disturbing part is that other abdominal muscles tend to ""sprain"" easily, maybe even tear. I had a golfball size swelling on the left side below my ribcage after skiing (I didn't fall or do anything involving strain). I asked my surgeon, and she said ""Couldn't be related to surgery -- you've had enough time to heal."" I think it is related. I've never had abdominal muscle problems of any kind ever. I would like to hear some comments from others...did you have discomfort past six weeks (14 weeks in my case), and eventually, did it go away? How do you gauge how much exercise you SHOULD do when muscles keep spraining or tearing? I'm a little surprised and concerned."

For the past several weeks she has been throwing absolutely cylonic tantrums in the mornings which start with obsessing about what she will wear that the other children won't be wearing the same thing to the last several days hiding under her bed and refusing to go to school, running away from the classroom screaming and crying. I usually have to leave her in her teacher's arms crying and doing a quick exit. She usually stops crying within minutes of my leaving and does great for the rest of the day. She is there from 9-3 pm T, Th and 9-1230p M,W,F. She says she just wants to be home with me and doesn't want to go to school and she misses me terribly.

While it worked for a couple of days doesn't work anymore. I just don't know what to do at this point and mornings are really wearing us both down!

SOCL	Emotional, Mental,  and Verbal Abuse--In My Marriage!	"I know we all known someone or people who have been in an abusive relationship? Therefore, I know someone can give me answers to my dilemma of my life. My husband and I have been married an year and four months now. The marriage has not been the greatest--actually the worse (with a few moments of happiness). I know marriage is hard work and no its not a walk in the park. But, when you are trying and the other person is not? Yes, it makes it VERY HARD!Well, he is very emotionally, mentally, and verbally abusive. I asked for counseling many times, sat down to talk to him about his behavior--he blows up of course. With hold sex--flat says no or says ""HE"" is not in the mood--way before my Hysterectomy Nov. 16,2011. Cussing, throws things, breaks my things, nit picks with me, tries to make me upset--especially when I keep the peace. Then when I do defend myself in an argument or one of his backlashes? He says: ""Don't raise your voice or get loud?"" but, I'm getting talked to like a dog...smh! He has NEVER hit me. But, what he is doing enough to feel like he has. Now, He has a good side: Nice, helpful, great provider, cooks, cleans, and works hard. But, its like little petty things can easily set him off!For examples: People on his job, anyone in the household, or he is just having a flat out bad day? He KEEPS apologizing over and over and over again! I've been tired a long time ago--tired of handing him out chance after chance. He becomes nice for a few days to a week or week and a half. Then bam! It happens again! I'm just tired of the same ole' lines: ""I'm sorry line."" ""I'm going to change line."" ""I'm going to do better line."" ""I'm going to treat you better line"" And NOTHING has taken place! I try to stay hopeful and prayerful for a change. I REALLY wanna a divorce. But, on the other hand I ALWAYS try to see things to the end. But, ""My heart and head hurts"".I'm a woman who does not nag--seriously I don't, I don't get an attitude--unless needed and sticking up for my self. I try to encourage, love, and motivative him. And this is what I get from him? Ugh! I'm so stressed and confused! Is it really LOVE on his end? Like he tells me or what? We just had an very nasty blow out a few days ago--mind you I'm still having health issues and this stress was/is not helping. He apologized as usual and he agreed to counseling--we'll see about that. I'm glad he agreed at least? Someone help me understand and give me some sound advice! Thanks in advice!"

SOCL	Democrats can't afford moral stand on campaign spending	"(Reuters) - After taking a beating at the ballot box in 2010 and losing the messaging war on healthcare reform to well-financed opponents, Democrats don't plan to take the high ground on campaign finance and ""Super PACs"" going into November's election.Traditionally, the party favors fundraising limits and disclosure of donors. But since a 2010 Supreme Court decision that allowed independent groups raise and spend unlimited funds to help campaigns, wealthy Republicans started donating to dozens of such ""super"" political action committees and plan to help their party outspend Democrats in what is expected to be the most expensive campaign in U.S. history.That, according to Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, has forced her party to adapt to a campaign finance system that she says allows wealthy anonymous donors to try to ""buy"" elections with unlimited donations.""We could set an example and lose,"" Wasserman Schultz told the Reuters Washington Summit on Wednesday. But, she added: ""I'm not going to stand on principle only to get run over by a truck.""Democrat Bill Burton helped create the Priorities USA Action Super PAC, which also has a non-profit advocacy arm, in 2011 to support President Barack Obama's re-election effort.Burton said the group had raised $40 million so far and plans to spend $100 million in this election cycle.That pales, though, next to entities like the conservative Crossroads groups founded by former George W. Bush adviser Karl Rove. Crossroads, which are a Super PAC and a related non-profit, has pledged to spend up to $300 million on 2012 races, two-thirds of it on defeating Obama.Efforts on both sides of the aisle are expected to top $1 billion in campaign spending this year.Democrats at the Reuters summit said that through traditional channels, groups such as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee are out-raising their Republican counterparts.But that will be far from counterbalancing the Super PACS and their wealthy backers, a lesson already ruefully learned.""Having watched what happened in the 2010 election ... we were concerned about what the outside Republican money could mean in this election,"" said Burton.The fuzzy lines surrounding political donations surfaced on Wednesday when the New York attorney general said he is investigating contributions to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, a tax-exempt group.The Chamber, is not required to disclose its donors, has been active in recent elections backing mostly Republican candidates.One of the outside groups whose spending and fundraising largely remain a mystery is the Chamber of Commerce, which backs business-friendly candidates and policies and commonly falls on the Republican side.On Wednesday, in the latest salvo against secret donors, a source confirmed to Reuters that the New York attorney general was investigating a charity connected to the Chamber for illegal donations.'NOT THE RULES WE WISH WE HAD'The role of Super PACS was seen in the bitterly contested Republican primary battle this spring.Candidates like former U.S. Senator Rick Santorum and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich were able to keep their campaigns going, and keep ads on the air, much longer with help from deep-pocketed political sugar daddies: businessman Foster Friess and casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, respectively.Burton said Democrats, having surveyed the landscape, are warming to the fight.""They are getting engaged at a much brisker pace than they were previously because if they don't, there will never be reform,"" said Burton. ""We go into this campaign season with the rules we have, not the rules we wish we had.""Guy Cecil, who runs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said his party was ""not going to unilaterally disarm and allow the other side to buy the election.""While praising the quality of campaigns many Democrats are running, ""I don't think that that message alone is strong enough to overcome $1 billion in spending.""SOURCE: http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/27/us-washington-summit-money-idUSBRE85Q1SR20120627"

PREG	Mirena IUD and side effects	I also posted this in Women's Health but would love as much input as possible.    Thank you.I had the Mirena IUD inserted about 2 months post-partum.    Since then I have had a couple of side effects that I think may be from the IUD and wanted to know if anyone else has had any of these (or others).The biggest problem is joint pain, primarily in my legs...although my back is pretty tight, but I suspect mostly from carrying the baby.    I looked into reasons for joint pain and Mirena IUD came up and thinking back it started about a month or so after I had the IUD put in.Others, I lost most of my pregnancy weight (except about 5-10 pounds) in the first 2 months p-partum but have now gained about 12 additional pounds (back to my 9-month pregnant weight). I am extremely fatigued, more than I should be even with a new baby, and low, low, low sex drive.Anyone else have these or other symptoms?    And, can anyone recommend another bc option -- I really don't want to go back on the pill and don't like condoms.    I'd love any input.Thanks!

PREG	Exclusively pumping, should i pump more?	Hi everyone! my baby girl is 2 weeks old on friday and we are exclusively breastfeeding/pumping. right out of the hospital i could produce 4 oz per 2-3 hours which i hear is a miracle for new moms. we tried breastfeeding but the last day at the hospital she got lazy and stopped trying to latch which led to her sleeping all day and not feeding so i started to pump there. (manual medela) i waited 4-5 days to buy a double breast pump incase she decided to try breast feeding again and ended up with a Lansinoh affinity double pump. ive been storing breast milk for her pretty well. i just basically pumped whenever i felt full and started keeping track of how much she ate vs how much i pump. when i finally got to counting and pumping on a schedule i noticed that my supply stayed the same and didnt increase. so what is the point of pumping 8 times a day if im getting the same amount pumping 6x? ive added in pumps in the middle of the night but its just stressful having to get up especially if shes actually sleeping 5 hours. and im not pumping more than 3-4 oz at that time anyways. should i continue to try to pump 8times a day including the night pump? or should i just relax and pump the way i did when i first got home, getting the same amount of milk?she eats anywhere from 19-22 oz a day and i pump 30-34oz
TRMT	HRT question after Hysterectomy and bilateral oophorectomy	I had a hysterectomy with bilateral oophorectomy and appendectomy due to severe endometriosis which had infiltrated my ovaries and was all over my other organs as well (plus a lot of endometriosis was also removed that had adhered to my bowels, bladder, and appendix) .    To help me avoid radical menopause sypmtoms, my doctor immediately started me on a .5 mg. Vivelle-dot estrogen patch after surgery, and I felt fine.     Two weeks later, he added a 100 mg. daily dose of prometrium to my HRT therapy to avoid recurrence of endometriosis growth.    My problem is that I am having unpleasant side effects from the prometrium, including exhaustion, minor headache, and lightheadedness.    I don't like how it makes me feel.    What other alternatives would you suggest to the 100 mg. prometrium?    Can I take a lower dose or cream that would possibly lessen these side effects?    I would prefer to take only the estrogen, but my doctor is concerned that it could stimulate the regrowth of endometriosis.    Thank you for your feedback.

DISE	Barrett's and Gerd	Hi,I was diagnosed with Gerd almost 15 years ago and I've had maybe two or three flareups over the years. I'm going in for an endoscopy next week and have been stressing a bit about Barrett's esophagus (cuz that's what I do).The things that's always seemed strange to me is that I really don't get heartburn. I just have a burning stomach that's kinda there all the time during my flare ups, but most of the time only comes on after I've had too much coffee or some other thing I shouldn't be doing.Also, when I get reflux, which is almost every time I eat regardless of flareups, it's not the common acidic/bitter taste that most people talk about. It's basically just the food that I've just eaten coming up. It doesn't burn.So those two things always seemed strange to me. No heartburn (which I understand is no too uncommon), and the non-burning, non-bitter, reflux.Since Barrett's is associated with acid coming up, I wonder if that's a big danger given my symptoms?Any thoughts?thanks so much in advance,Michael

SOCL	Can I Get A Witness?  Woo-Hoo!!!	"First National Tea Party Convention in Nashville, TN, last night...    This Judge Roy Moore was on FIRE !    He cited such patriots as Thomas Paine, James Madison, Samuel Adams and Patrick Henry and he received FOUR standing ovations during his impassioned speech.    This guy, Roy Moore, is running for governor of Alabama.He then began to paraphrase the Declaration of Independence. But rather than addressing grievances to the king of Britain, Moore presented Obama with his own ""bill of particulars"":""He has ignored our history and our heritage, arrogantly declaring to the world that we are no longer a Christian nation. He's elevated immorality to a new level, setting aside the entire month of June last to celebrate Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual and Transgender pride.He now threatens to change our law, 10 U.S.C. Section 654, to allow homosexuality in our military in direct opposition to the law which says that the attempt to engage in homosexuality will create an unacceptable risk to the high standards of morale, good order and discipline and unit cohesion that are the essence of military capability.He has apologized to the Arab world for our past, subjugated our national sovereignty by bowing down to the king of Saudi Arabia.He has pursued a socialist agenda by taking control of private companies and pushing a national health-care plan with a public option. Backed by a willing Congress, he has bought off our senators and our representatives with our own money in an effort to mandate this agenda. And when opposed by members of the Senate, he smugly smiled and said, ""I won.""Moore concluded his list with a direct quote from the Declaration: ""A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.""***Posted: February 05, 201011:50 pm Eastern on WND.COM***"

PREG	This is too funny,, How ur body can play tricks on u.	This is to the ones thats trying TTC. Hopefully this will help u all.If you are on a 28 day cycle, your most fertile time CAN be 14 days after the first day of your last af....but if you are irregular that is not the case....the period of time from the first day of a woman's period and ovulation can vary greatly, it's the leutal phase(time from ovulation to menstruation) that doesn't vary as greatly....a woman usually always starts her period 10 to 16 days after ovulation. So if you have a 25 day cycle, you could ovulate anywhere from cd9 to cd 15.....if you have a 30 day cycle, you could ovulate anywhere from cd 14 to cd 20. If you have a 35 day cycle you could ovulate anywhere from cd19 to cd 25.....and this could vary from month to month, but it will usually be somewhere within that time frame...also, your body could go haywire one month and not ovulate til really late or ovulate really early...but then you should expect your period to either come really late(for late ovulation) or really early(for early ovulation) as that 10 to 16 day period doesn't change. I hope this makes sense!
PREG	whats wrong	my periods have been irregular i went to the gyn last month and the docter said im producing to many eggs,and said i need to be on birth control to make my periods regular. so i didnt have my period last month and i still havent had it and usally when i skip a month i always start on the 1st or 2nd of the new month and this time i didnt so now its been 1 month and 2 weeks since i havent had it i feel sick all the time where i cant keep my food down and im starting to get stretch marks on ma boobs and the side of ma stomach someone plz give me advice on wats going on.
SOCL	Dad of missing Ore. boy says he suspects stepmom	"Dad of missing Ore. boy says he suspects stepmomBy TIM FOUGHT and NIGEL DUARA, AP10 hours agoLoading... Share No Thanks Must Read?Thank YouYes         222news-national-20100707-US.Missing.Oregon.BoyBirth mother Desiree Young, right, and father Kaine Horman speak about their...Share |* Email Story* Discuss* PrintPORTLAND, Ore. Ã¢ € ” The father of a 7-year-old Portland boy missing for more than a month told a judge he believes the boy's stepmother is involved in the disappearance, according to a court document released Thursday.The father, Kaine Horman, also said in his request for a restraining order against Terri Moulton Horman that investigators told him that he had been the target of a murder plot by his wife in late 2009.The decision to obtain a restraining order late last month ""was based on a lot of information provided by law enforcement,"" Kaine Horman said Thursday. He declined to elaborate.Before Kyron Horman's disappearance on June 4, Kaine Horman said his relationship with his wife was ""a nice clean slate, as far as I can tell.""The court documents appeared to confirm a report Sunday by The Oregonian newspaper about allegations that Terri Horman had sought to have someone kill her husband several months before the boy's disappearance.Desiree Young, the boy's biological mother, said Thursday at a news conference that she suspected Terri Horman's involvement soon after the boy was reported missing.""I've known her a long time,"" Young said. ""I know she's lying.""Investigators have not named Terri Horman as suspect or a person of interest, but in recent weeks they have focused their investigation on her. They distributed fliers asking for information on her whereabouts the day the boy vanished.A call to Terri Horman's lawyer was not immediately returned Thursday.Police have said she was the last known person to see the boy. She told police she left him at his school, about two miles away from their home, after an early morning science fair.A former teacher and ex-bodybuilder, Terri Horman had become increasingly isolated from family members.Late last month, Kaine Horman moved out of the couple's home in the countryside west of downtown Portland, filed for divorce and got the restraining order against his wife Ã¢ € ” including a provision that she not have access to firearms or ammunition.That restraining order was unsealed by a judge on Thursday, following requests by a coalition of news organizations, including The Associated Press, that it be made public.The order contained the first publicly released suspicion by Kaine Horman that his wife was connected to Kyron Horman's disappearance.""I believe respondent is involved in the disappearance of my son Kyron who has been missing since June 4, 2010,"" Kaine Horman's petition reads. ""I also recently learned that respondent attempted to hire someone to murder me. The police have provided me with probable cause to believe the above two statements to be true.""His statement contained no details on how Terri Horman might be involved in the boy's disappearance.The sheriff's office has refused to confirm details of the alleged murder-for-hire plot and did so again Thursday.Kaine and Terri Horman were married in April 2007 and have a 19-month-old daughter, who is now living with Kaine Horman. Terri Horman also has a teenage son from the first of two previous marriages.The investigation has become one of the most intense in recent Oregon history, and has attracted national attention.At the start of the search, Terri Horman organized friends to pass out fliers. She also appeared at two early news conferences with other members of the family. She has not appeared at press conferences since.The boy's parents on Thursday reiterated their contention that Terri Horman isn't cooperating with investigators Ã¢ € ” despite assurances from a local sheriff that she is Ã¢ € ” and continued to call on her to tell investigators the truth.""She needs to do the right thing, being honest,"" Young said.""Whatever that truth is,"" Kaine Horman added.Kaine Horman said Terri Horman failed a polygraph test twice."

GOAL	Root Canal?	HiI broke the outer half of an upper molar (filled) some years ago and did nothing about it. The break was above the gum line. It gave me no trouble.    Recently I have noticed an occasional very slight headache on the same side of my head and very faint sensitivity in my cheek.    The broken tooth is very briefly sensitive to hot and cold.    It is not sensitive to pressure or discoloured.I visited a new dentist who examined and drilled the tooth.    He then placed a temporary white filling and told me to return in 4 days for root canal treatment.    He did not take an x ray.I am currently in no discomfort whatsoever.    Is it likely that I need root canal treatment?    I am reluctant to undergo this if not strictly necessary.Many Thx
TRMT	Vegetarian, Hypothyroidism and Memory	I've been a vegetarian for the last five years, almost. There were a few points where I was vegan for months at a time. Right now I do eat eggs and some dairy occasionally but no fish. I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism about three years ago...but I have reason to believe that I had it long before. I remember how my body felt years ago...so I don't want to blame vegetarianism for my hypothyroidism. Getting to my point- I've had pretty bad memory loss for a few years now as well. I'm not sure if it's related to the vegetarianism though. I personally think it's more associated with the hypothyroidism. I make sure I get b vitamins, calcium, omega fatty acids in my diet. I've had my levels checked for the typical bloods and everything seems normal. It's just this memory problem...I don't want to go back to eating meat. But what else can I do to try to help this...along the lines of including things in my diet? Anyone have this problem and find a solution or are struggling to? Thanks

DISE	Vytorin Reequest Dr. Bogart	"Hi Doug,My question today is should Steve continue to take the Vytorin.    Merck & Schering-Plough finally released the trial studies and    findings showing Zetia, if I am interpreting the information correctly, is not the choice of drug for a patient that has genetics which cause abnormally high levels of blood cholesterol. Please see excerpt from Study Released January 14, 2008.    Also, of great concern, the note of fact that plaque build up in arteries was almost double.""The new ENHANCE trial -- which involved patients with a genetic condition that causes abnormally high levels of blood cholesterol -- found no such added benefit. According to a statement released by the two drug companies Monday, researchers found no statistically significant difference in heart attacks or stroke among trial participants who took Zetia plus Zocor, a widely used cholesterol-lower drug, versus those who got Zocor alone.The study also noted that the speed at which arteries thickened with plaque almost doubled among those on the two-drug regimen compared to those taking Zocor alone.""Jeanne Gwin"

I had a blighted ovum in 11/06, then went on to have a healthy pregnancy in 12/06, delivered dd in 9/07 so I haven't gotten a period since and therefore we have nothing to judge conception by.

TRMT	EATING PROBLEMS	Our 3.5 mth baby girl was placed on Alimentum & rice cereal due to relflux.    She currently has started eating maybe .5-1 oz of a 4 oz bottle.    She will grin and play with the nipple for a while and then she starts to get fussy.    Sometimes we have to feed her bit by bit before she will drink the entire bottle.    Maybe 2-3 feedings will she take the entire bottle.    Also the peditrician has recently prescribe zantac to help with the reflux.    Is this normal,    has she become a picky eater or is there an underlying problem?
SOCL	doesnt know	I have been having problems awhile with itching a burning feeling...im not sure if i have volvodynia or something else...i dont feel that its a yeast infection bc of the area that it is in, which is labia minora.    i can say this that one side has always seemed bigger the other side.    when i sweat or get wet, its a bad discomfort for me, but it doesnt hurt to have sex, unless there is foreplay...thems seems to only really bother me, after i get done with my period..
SOCL	also needing employment	"I first want to say that I have read all the posts and you are all in my prayers.    I just recently went through withdrawal from prescription pain medication.    I had no idea I was even addicted until a doctor changed my medication.    I was clueless when the withdrawal symptoms began because I was never addicted to anything before.    Even when I went to the emergency room the docs had no idea what was going on even though they saw the meds I was on and what I had been taken off of.    When I finally got to see my gp he asked me if I felt like I was going through withdrawal and all I could say was ""I don't know, I've never been addicted to anything""    It turned out that I had a hypersensitivity to the medication that caused me to become addicted    even though I was taking a small dose.    Anyway, I lost my job because the withdrawal was severe enough to cause me to miss work.    My old boss said I'm on the top of the list for rehire but with the economy, as everyone is aware, business is slow.    So I'm now in the same boat as many of you are.    My husband barely makes enough money for us to pay bills and most of our food comes from a church food bank.    I have type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure and losing weight is a little difficult right now cause most of the food given us is carbohydrates, which is really not good for a diabetic, and high fat meats.    Now, sorry for such    a long post, but I am not by any means looking for sympathy because there are those in worse shape than me, I just covet you prayers.    Arthritis in my hips makes standing a long time difficult but I do believe that God will help me deal with it.    I believe that as we pray for each other it will take our minds off ourselves and open up the way for God to do a work.    So now in closing "" I thank you Father God, that in the name of Jesus, you have provided all our needs according to Your riches in glory by Christ Jesus.    I thank for healing all my sisters and brothers in spirit soul and body. Thank you Father, that the joy of the Lord is our strength.    I declare that jobs, finances and healing are now ours in Jesus name.    Amen    Love you all and God bless."

DEMO	Irregular period due to contraception changes?	Alright...At the beginning of January 2009, I stopped taking the birth control pill because I suspected that the hormone levels were too high for me. At that point I'd been on the particular pill for a year and a half and was noticing I was far more depressed and crabby than usual--particularly just before it was time to take the sugar pills. The nurse at the health clinic suggested I stay off the pill for three months and see if I notice any emotional changes. I told her I would be sexually active during the time between and she gave me a bunch of condoms.Anyway, I'm usually pretty regular with my periods, and it came a week late in January--I figured this was due to my body adjusting to not being on the pill anymore. My period at this time was also much lighter than it usually was before I was on the pill--I usually experience bad cramps and heavy flow, but my period was light and painless like it was when I was on the pill.Now comes February, and I was expecting my period on the twentieth or so, but it still hasn't arrived... and we're at March 4th.My boyfriend and I have used a condom each time we've had intercourse, the condom has never broken or torn and (this is perhaps too much information), I get VERY wet during intercourse, so lubrication is not a problem for us either.Anyway, I've been feeling bloated and gassy for the past week, have been experiencing slight cramping and constipation, and figured my period would arrive. It still hasn't, and I've noticed that my regular discharge has thickened--and it looks very similar to the egg white cervical mucous that I used to see before I was on the pill.Basically, my question is: Are my hormones out of whack because of the birth control pill, and I'm only now starting ovulation again (as could be the case due to the mucous)? Or should I go out and get a pregnancy test? I really don't think I'm pregnant, but it's still frustrating to be late when you're trying NOT to get pregnant.
FAML	Change of behaviour in 10 year pld	My grand-daughter has just today turned 10.    Her mom and dad are divorced, but on fairly good terms.    My son is remarried to a girl whom the kids love.    Lately my 10 year old granddaughter does not want to go to her dad's.    She goes into her bedroom and stays there, she will not eat (even her birthday cake).    She has been lying , and text messaging four letter words to her friends.She also has bouts of diarrhea when she comes to my son's.    Jusy last year she wanted to comelive with her dad and his new wife permanently.    He told her that he would love that, but she must discuss it first of all with her mom.    Now, she doesn't even want to come when it's his weekend to have them.    They (my son and his wife) have an 18 month old son, whom both the girls love very much, but lately the one granddaughter doesn't even bother with him.Her mother is very manipulative, and I am wondering if this could be caused by something that is going on in her mothers home.    Her mother works nights, and her stepdad takes care of both the girls.    He is very good to them.I have a bi-polar condition and my son used to suffer from anxiety.    Could any of this be influencing my granddaughter.We love her so much, and so desperately need advice and guidance.Any help will be appreciated.Thank you

They are sensitive to the touch and very painful, they swell, weep a clear fluid and have a white puss that comes out when squeezed.

DEMO	Lump Near Pubic Bone	I am 16 years old.    Over the past few weeks I have noticed a lump that is right near my pubic bone.    It has grown into the size of a small marble.    I asked my mom about it and she said that all it was is something ingrown that is probably filled with some type of liquid.    It is becoming more painful and I think it might be something serious.    Please, I need help.

FAML	8 year old Son, lying and stealing	My 8 year old son, has been stealing items from home and taking them to school,    (A special necklace and it gets broken),    he steals $20 and lies about taking it.    The teacher sends a note home and he rips it out from his planner.    This entire school year he has tried to get the teacher and I into arguments. (I don't understand why?)    My son is very intelligent, creative and knows right from wrong.    He makes wonderful grades and is on no medication (other than an asthma inhaler).    But for some reason he feels he needs to lie instead of telling the truth.    He continously tries to make other adults feel sorry for him.    I have tried everything and nothing is working.    I have tried time outs, taking away favorite toys, grounding him, suspending certain priviledges.    I have talked with him and tried to guide him the best I can.    But right now nothing is working.    Does anyone have any suggestions?
GOAL	post-op problems with Tecnis Multifocal	I had tecnis multifocal lens implanted about 1 month ago.    I am having halos, glare, lack of contrast in colors, diminished depth perception, things look hazy, but my near vision is OK.    Surgeon thinks it is due to astigamatism and wants to do PRK to correct it, but he thinks it may not make me happy.    He thinks I should consider removing that lens and replacing it with a monofocal lens.Should I expect the vision problems to decrease over time.    I was hoping to have perfect vision, but is that not realistic?    I was wondering if others have experienced these problems and had them go away, over time, or if this is, unfortunately, normal for lens implants.    Should I get the implants removed.Please help
FAML	Misbehaving - age 5	My son is 5yrs of age.    He is extremely funny and smart. However, in the last few months he    is using words such as I hate you, fat face, fat bum - he says to his brother - I'll punch you in the face (he never has though) and like other people's questions I have read he also does not seem to care about things such as time out, a small smack on the bum or taking away of toys...he laughs when I am telling him off.    He does sit in his time out calmly but the minute he comes out he sometimes starts his attitude right back up.    I don;t have a certain reason he could be acting like this - could it just be the Summer months and not having a proper schedule - no moving house, no new baby...He acts like a tough guy but he is very sensitive - he gets upset easily if he thinks anyone is making fun of him or if he falls down and hurts himself he looses it (though he is getting a bit better with the latter).    He is good at school - he has friends and his teachers love him to bits. Anyway, enough talking for now - I just wanted to see what you thought.    Is this something that just passes and then if so what is the best way to punish if continues for a while...Thank you.

SOCL	Ill child with WBC of 300	My daughter has been ill for four weeks. She was admitted into hospital after two weeks of a diarroeah for one week, vomiting for another week. Then she had a sore throat and a temperature of 39.9. She was put on a drip for dehydration and had her WBC checked which came back at 300. She had a clear result from her urine and a scan of her bowel suggested a slight inflammation, as did her bladder, but no conclusive diagnosis. She has a bloated stomach and has done for months. She is also very pale and tired. She was discharged from hospital as her fever dropped. It is now 39 again, she has developed a cough and is wheezy. She has been on both IV and oral antibiotics for 2 weeks but is still not better. I am concerned that her WBC was not re-taken after her fever came down and that such a high level may be indicative of something else. What should I do now?

DISE	Racing Heart with Bowel Movement (sorry*)	Hi thereCan anybody put my mind at rest as to why I experience an increased heart rate when I have my daily bowel movements?    I'm not sure whether it's become a learned behaviour from my anxiety or if it's medical/bacteria related?I have GAD and have had for about 5/6 years. But this symptom has been occurring only for a few months or so.It builds up and once I have finished with my BM my heart rate slows and I feel better.    It's very strange.    I do have heart neurosis along with my GAD and when this is happening I check my pulse which is a regular (bad) habit for me.I do hope somebody out there who 'knows' facts can help.Thank you in advance :)
PREG	Am I getting my hopes up?	"I had my first IUI (Clomid only; no trigger or prometrium) on the 15th. I know that implantation happens on day 5 or 6. Yesterday I felt really 'odd'. I had, what I can only describe, as upper vaginal/cervical twinges. When I got home I was super, super, super tired where all I wanted to do was sleep. And then super crabby the last 2 days. I know that I'm probably just getting regular PMS-symptoms but with the semen count of 50 million, part of me wonders could this really be it? Would one get any pregnancy symptoms this early?I'm sure this is all in my head. My husband goes ""you never were pregnant so how would you know that it isn't true?""I just don't want to get my hopes up. But this crabbiness is out of control. If I get AF, I'm not due until the 31st."

SOCL	Facts revealed.	"I think this is interesting. Misleading and false statements made by various guests on various television news programs over the weekend. Various Subjects. Factcheck.org reveals the truth and points out the lies.Sunday ReplayJuly 5, 2010Bookmark and SharePoliticians didnÃ¢ € ™t take a holiday from false and misleading statements on July 4. We found misstatements on the Sunday talk shows that touched on Afghanistan, Michael Steele and immigration.A Firm Date for Ã¢ € ¦ What Exactly?On ABCÃ¢ € ™s ""This Week,"" Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona made it sound as though President Obama would pull all troops out of Afghanistan in July 2011, regardless of what happens in the country. But the president never promised that all troops, or even a certain number, would be withdrawn. Instead, in announcing his decision to send an additional 30,000 troops to Afghanistan, Obama said he would ""begin the transfer"" in July 2011, ""taking into account conditions on the ground.""McCain: But what I worry about more than anything else is the Ã¢ € ” the July of 2011 firm date, which the president has not Ã¢ € ” certainly has not been positive as far as our commitment is concerned. In other words, we need a conditions-based situation, not a date for withdrawal. Ã¢ € ¦But the fact is that, if you say that you are setting a date certain for leaving as his key advisers have, including, I think, one on your show that said that we were Ã¢ € ” that it is a, quote, ""firm date,"" his spokesperson said itÃ¢ € ™s, quote, ""etched in stone and he has the chisel,"" and other statements by his civilian advisers have undermined the belief that we will have a conditions-based withdrawal.McCain does accurately describe the words of White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs, who told CBS News Chief White House Correspondent Chip Reid in December 2009 that the July 2011 date was, in ReidÃ¢ € ™s words, ""etched in stone"" and that troops would start coming home then.HereÃ¢ € ™s what Obama said in December 2009:Obama, December 2009: But taken together, these additional American and international troops will allow us to accelerate handing over responsibility to Afghan forces, and allow us to begin the transfer of our forces out of Afghanistan in July of 2011. Just as we have done in Iraq, we will execute this transition responsibly, taking into account conditions on the ground. WeÃ¢ € ™ll continue to advise and assist AfghanistanÃ¢ € ™s security forces to ensure that they can succeed over the long haul. But it will be clear to the Afghan government Ã¢ € ” and, more importantly, to the Afghan people Ã¢ € ” that they will ultimately be responsible for their own country.More recently, on June 24, Obama reiterated that: ""We did not say that starting July 2011, suddenly there would be no troops from the United States or allied countries in Afghanistan. We didnÃ¢ € ™t say weÃ¢ € ™d be switching off the lights and closing the door behind us. What we said is weÃ¢ € ™d begin a transition phase in which the Afghan government is taking on more and more responsibility.""More Dubious Deadline ClaimsOn CBSÃ¢ € ™ Ã¢ € œFace the Nation,Ã¢ €  Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina repeated a false statement he made last week on ""Fox News Sunday."" Graham claimed that White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel had said July 2011 was ""a firm date of withdrawal"" from Afghanistan. Emanuel wasnÃ¢ € ™t that definitive.Graham: The problem is, youÃ¢ € ™ve had Rahm Emanuel, youÃ¢ € ™ve had David Axelrod, and other people saying that July 2011 is a firm date of withdrawal.Emanuel actually said on ABCÃ¢ € ™s ""This Week"" on June 20 that the ""firm date"" is one that ""deals with the troops that are part of the surge, the additional 30,000. What will be determined at that date or going into that date will be the scale and scope of that reduction."" Emanuel didnÃ¢ € ™t say that all troops, or even a significant number, would be withdrawn on that date. He said the number coming home would be ""based on the conditions on the ground.Ã¢ € As for White House Senior Advisor David Axelrod, he said on ""Meet the Press"" on June 13 that the White House Ã¢ € œis committed to begin that process of withdrawal in July of next year, and that continues to be the plan, and weÃ¢ € ™re going to pursue that on that schedule.Ã¢ € SteeleÃ¢ € ™s Retraction?Both Sens. Joseph Lieberman and Lindsey Graham said that Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele had retracted his controversial comments about the war in Afghanistan, which Steele called ""a war of ObamaÃ¢ € ™s choosing."" Steele did clarify his remarks, but he didnÃ¢ € ™t apologize. WeÃ¢ € ™ll leave it to readers to decide whether his response could be called a retraction.Graham said on Ã¢ € œFace the NationÃ¢ €  that he is Ã¢ € œglad to see that Michael Steele is retracting his statement because itÃ¢ € ™s not the Republican PartyÃ¢ € ™s position, my Republican Party position.Ã¢ €  Meanwhile, Lieberman, an Independent from Connecticut, said on ""Fox News SundayÃ¢ €  that Steele had ""retracted"" his comments.HereÃ¢ € ™s what Steele originally said at a July 1 fundraiser in Connecticut:Steele July 1: Keep in mind, again, our federal candidates, this was a war of ObamaÃ¢ € ™s choosing. This is not, this is not something the United States had actively prosecuted or wanted to engage in. Ã¢ € ¦[I]f heÃ¢ € ™s such a student of history, has he not understood that, you know, thatÃ¢ € ™s the one thing you donÃ¢ € ™t do is engage in a land war in Afghanistan? All right? Because everyone who has tried over a thousand years of history has failed. Ã¢ € ¦ There are other ways that we can engage in Afghanistan without committing more troops. Ã¢ € ¦Steele then encouraged candidates running for office to make use of ""a whole text of resources"" available through the RNC and Republican congressional committees that ""help frame those arguments.""Republicans were quick to condemn SteeleÃ¢ € ™s remarks, and the following day Steele released an official statement clarifying his stance on the war. He emphasized the necessity of winning in Afghanistan as well as his support for the troops and General PetraeusÃ¢ € ™ confirmation. But he didnÃ¢ € ™t disavow his original remarks.Steele, July 2: During the 2008 Presidential campaign, Barack Obama made clear his belief that we should not fight in Iraq, but instead concentrate on Afghanistan. Now, as President, he has indeed shifted his focus to this region. That means this is his strategy. And, for the sake of the security of the free world, our country must give our troops the support necessary to win this war.As we have learned throughout history, winning a war in Afghanistan is a difficult task. We must also remember that after the tragedy of September 11, 2001, it is also a necessary one. That is why I supported the decision to increase our troop force and, like the entire United States Senate, I support General PetraeusÃ¢ € ™ confirmation. The stakes are too high for us to accept anything but success in Afghanistan."

TRMT	Tram flap problem years later	7 years after Breast Cancer, Mastectomy, reconstruction & tram Flap surgery, I am experiencing tight, wrenching pain when bending over during yoga. Sometimes it is on the right side (where there is a large visible bulge when I lay down and lift my head) other times it is directly under the breast area near the sternum. I have had 2 doctors    (my Oncologist & a surgeon) tell me it looks like a hernia. The surgeon ordered a cat scan with contrast and that awful tasting barium, and now reports he sees no evidence of hernia, and no other testing indicated. So I am back to sqaure one and out of pocket expenses are rising with no firm answer for what is causing the pain. My original plastic surgeon is not someone I trust as I was never satisfied with the scarring afterward or his follow up on questions I had. I realize that diagnosis is difficult for many doctors but how can you dismiss obvious problems like viselike pain, by saying it's not a hernia, so it must be nothing of concern? That does not make sense. Is there anyone out there who is able to help me with this?

FAML	Duarte Galactosemia and Developmental/Speech Delays	"Hi. I am mother to a five year old G/D girl named Madison. At day 9, the dr. office called me and told me to IMMEDIATELY stop all nursing and milk formula, to go to the health dept., that they were opening a special Sat. clinic just for her, and to report to the outpatient lab at the hospital as soon as they opened on that Monday. Needless to say, I was scared out of my wits. She was dxed with D/G with a level that I can't recall. I know the number is not supposed to ever go down, but I can't help noticing that she has issues that sound alot like CG.    Madison has a speech delay, developmental delays, possibly an autisim spectrum disorder PDD, and vision problems. I can't help but wonder if despite the ""experts"" saying that they will not have any issues, if all of this is related. Perhaps it's just a coincidence but I am having her levels tested again anyway. I do remember that she was at the 5% levels at one year. Anyone else feel this way or have children with delays?"
FAML	5 1/2 yr old becoming violent	My step son has lived with his mother and her grandparents since he was 3 months old.    He and his mother not only share a room, but the bed.    At our house, he has his own room, space, and 'big boy' bed.We have determined that my step son has two different personalities in each home.    At our home, my husband and I also have a 5 month old.    My step son adores him and helps out.    He helps me with the laundry, dishes, and sometimes cooking food.    He's involved a lot.    However, he does not like to be in a room by himself.    For example, if we are all outside and he has to potty, he will not come inside to go with out one of us.    He is very polite and well behaved. At his mom's residents it's a totally different story.    He has told us that he will play and pee himself, because he doesn't want to stop what he's doing.    He told us that he has a 'pee basket' where he puts his wet clothes. His mother tells us that he is completely disrepectful to her, and her grandparents.    He throws temper tantrums if he doesn't get his way. They do not interact with him, they just put him in front of the tv, because it's easier. He has spit, and thrown toys at his mother. His mother took him to a psychogist and the doctor told us and the mother that my step son would be better living with us and his mother having visition. Once the doctor told her that, she removed him from therapy.    Sometimes he stares off into space, and ingores when someone is speaking to him.    Just 2 weeks ago the mother told my husband that their son told her 'mommy one day you are going to be under water'    'maybe i'll want you dead'    We are really concerned where this is coming from.    Yesterday at school, he got mad at another student and said 'I'll shoot you in your tummy'What should we do?    We have tried to remove him from that home.    The courts told her to get her own place, and she has a section 8 apartment, but refuses to live there.    We have fought twice for custody and both times we did not get my step son. The judge said she did not have enough 'material change' for her to remove him from that home.What should we do?    We are really concerned for his well being and mentality. Please help
TRMT	MMR Vaccine Question	I am 35 years old and in good health. I had my MMR shots when I was a child and I am trying to enroll in a college now, and they need a copy of my immunization records. Strangely enough, NO ONE can find any record of my receiving the vaccine. I've tried previous employers, my high school, my doctor's office and the NYS Dept. of Health. My mother is 100% sure that I got it.My question is: Is it safe to get the shot again now? That seems to be my only option at this point, as I currently don't have insurance and cannot afford the $300 to get the bloodwork test performed. Are there any risks, side effects or reasons that I should not get this shot again?ANY info on this matter at all would be greatly appreciated. thank you.
DISE	Boyfriend thinks there's a problem...	"My partner thinks there is something wrong with me. He thinks I have depression or some other type of mental disorder, but I have done A LOT of research into mental health and I can't seem to find anything that ""fits"". I know you can't diagnose yourself just by reading a magazine article or a website about mental health, but I've looked into the DSM-II, studied Psychology at a VCE level and read quite a few articles from medical journals about it. My boyfriend has been diagnosed with depression and anxiety and takes medication for it, and I've been to a few psychiatrist appointments with him so I know the signs of depression (the appointments were for him, not for me). I've talked to several doctors about how I feel and they say it's completely normal, but I'm an ""emotionally sensitive person"". I agree with that ""diagnosis"" I guess you could call it, but the way I feel is causing a lot of problems especially with my relationship with my boyfriend.Soo...I don't know what to do. He wants me to go straight to a psychiatrist but I don't think that's the best option. Should I just talk to another doctor? He's written out a list of things that he thinks are wrong but I don't reckon those things relate to depression at all. I have mood swings and get angry and irritated very easily. I always feel lethargic, and get very sleepy at the end of the day even though I usually sleep fine throughout the night (my sleep can be disturbed by nightmares or sometimes vivid dreams). I get anxious, particularly in social situations, but not so much anymore because I'm going to university now and I've been forced into social interaction. It's just sweaty palms, feeling frightened and an increase in respiration rate so nothing like a panic attack or full-blown anxiety. I cry very easily and anything can set me off into a bad mood. My bad moods can be anything from feeling very sad and crying, feeling empty and just emotionless, very angry and irritated, or just a ""bleh"" sort of feeling."

TRMT	Depression	I just went through a hysterectomy 11 days ago.    I was having severe pain on my right side.    When checked out on ultrasound- stated it was 7.5 cm.    I traveled to another island to see the ob/gyn.    She did a complete hysterectomy since the ovary was covered by endometriosis, was internally bleeding, and full of several cysts.    when removing the uterus, they found it was fused with the bladder and the intestines.    They finally got everything out, except the cervix which they stitched closed.Two days ago, I had half of the staples removed (there were 22 of them and some are infected). They will remove the others today.    For two days now, I have been very depressed, wanting to cry every few minutes.    Is this normal? I was so upbeat when I had the surgery- often walking and overdoing it the first few days home.    Now it seems I am so LOW beat.    (I even went by myself to the other island to have the surgery- no one was with me or any physical/emotional support except prayers). I am just concerned as if this is a normal step to go through the process? Please help if you can.Lollybeth
DEMO	I am so scared of surgery etc.	"I am very scared of doctors, hospitals, tests, needles, ""medicine"". The only medicine I use is my inhaler for asthma if I really need it. I have allergies/chronic sinus problems, and I can't even take pills for that. I have had a digestive disorder, undiagnosed, for the past 2 years and it controls my life, all I can mostly eat is white bread, noodles, rice, some veggies, lean meat and water. My immune system has never been good and I get stressed and sick very easily. I also have some anxiety issues. Last month by chance I actually went to the ER for kidney pain, because of kidney stones, but I couldn't even take any pain meds for it and that pain was really bad. But then went away a while later. I think I've been getting kidney stones sometimes this year. I let them do a cat scan and ultra sound and that's all. They said they couldn't find anything wrong with my kidneys (and I believe they are wrong) but they said they found a cyst, and called it an ""ovarian cyst""...even though it's not even attatched to any ovary. It's behind my bladder and 12 cm big. I went to a gynecologist, I didn't let her do anything...just talked and left. She wasn't even that helpful. Then, my mom made me go to another gynecologist, who's also a surgeon. And he said this thing, although they don't think it's cancerous from what it looks like, is big and has to be removed or    it could rupture or ""seed out"" into other areas of my body, which would mean I'd be needing surgeries all of my life for tumors. They wanted blood work and for me to have an exam, but no way I am ever having an exam, and I am still TRYING to get myself to get a blood test. It's so hard for me, all of this.Anyways....I am SO VERY terrified of surgery...and everything. I can't handle this. I don't know what I'm going to do. I don't think I'd make it. With how my health is, I don't know if I will really recover good enough and what if I get a serious reaction to the anesthesia. What if something goes wrong? and what if I get a serious side effect or blood clots or just anything? And I can't handle blood tests, What if I can't breathe well enough because of my asthma?I'm mostly worried about after surgery. During it, you don't feel or remember anything right? but what if you wake up during it? And I heard you get a breathing tube and catheter. Ugh. I don't want some catheter. It's disgusting, uncomfortable and embarrassing....well, everything is embarrassing about surgery too. but I hate all of this. And there's risk for infection. And I hate IVs. EVERYTHING about all this, Im so phobic about. This is why I never really go to doctors, and I don't take medicines. *sigh* There's more to it. It's so much to try to explain. I'm just looking for advice or something."

SOCL	irritation?	during sex my vagina started to burn as if i cut myself. i stopped in the middle cause of the pain it didnt hurt unless i touched it so i was very carefull not to. i figured i had cut myself shaving and i irritated it. but then the itching and burning had gotten worst i went to the doctor and there was no cut or infection found. i got perscribed a antifungis cream but its still an annoying pain, what could it possibly be. btw im a lesbian so i was having sex with a girl when this happened.
PREG	Semen Analysis	So Ladies, doc just called with husbands results from the second analysis (done at a different office).    This is the sample that was used for the IUI.    Last time the count was about 65 million, this time it was just over 20 million, but she said it can vary quite a bit with each one (there were 7.7 mill after the wash, is this good?.........) The motility was 59%, which is up 9% from the last time. The morphology was 3% last time (the reason for doing the IUI so they could be washed), and this time it was 5%, so their shapes increased by about 2%.... so I have hope.    I made it through the first week, have 1 more week and a day or so before the beta. Please continue to pray!!

DISE	tremors you cant see muscle twiches fatigue	I am a 29 year old female.    Ive had allergies to common things and arthritis since the 3rd grade.    I was diagnosed as bipolar in the 9th grade, and really have had everything under great control for years.    I had my gallbladder out on 2/4/09 and the surgery went great. I can now eat whatever I want and have no digestion problems whatsoever.    One week after the surgery I got a pretty rough sinus infection and had to take three different antibiotics to get over it.    Before I even started the second one I had started feeling like I was shaking.    My arms just felt like they were vibrating.    I was easily exhausted and would get very light headed.    The sinus infection finnally went away and most of the light headed ness, but the exhaustion has stayed and the tremors I cant see have gotten worse and sometimes I shake very visible.    Just my arms and hand.    My muscles have started twitching all the time. Kind of like when a dr taps you reflexes, my arms and legs are constantly doing that.    Jerking and twitching all over day and night.    My family Dr says she thought it was an inner ear problem but this just does not make sense to me .    I would appreciate any advice that anyone has. Thanks

I have finally came to terms with this , I am as prepared as possible. she is alert and they are keeping the pain down. I can see when it hits her, first her hands start to move around trying to scatter the pain, then she becomes very restless, then her face starts showing    how intense it is. The pain medicine only takes a few minutes to take affect, but it is enough for me to see how bad it is for her.    She sat for an hour holding hands with Chris today, her brother with Downs, that seemed to help, she is still eating solids and taking a stool softner daily.    we will take her home Thur or Fri,    her 3 brothers that have gone canoeing    up North called her today, when then found a hill they could use the cell from.    that seemed to help also, they will be home Sunday. My car gave out on me today, some bolt let loose and the transmission fell down,    I had the cops and a wrecker to help me.    I will be staying all night with her 3 times a week from now on, at home, I only cry when I pass places in town that meant so much to us.    I do not want any one to feel sorry for me, and I am sorry to see that some of you    are hurting and some that are just starting this journey, it isn't all bad, there are many good days.    Live every day to the fullest and laugh alot, Les and I laughed today and it felt so good.     More later    Marty

SOCL	Leaked E-mail: Fox News caught slanting news reporting	"http://carloz.newsvine.com/_news/2010/12/09/5619834-leaked-e-mail-fox-news-caught-slanting-news-reporting-At the height of the health care reform debate last fall, Bill Sammon, Fox News' controversial Washington managing editor, sent a memo directing his network's journalists not to use the phrase ""public option.""Instead, Sammon wrote, Fox's reporters should use ""government option"" and similar phrases -- wording that a top Republican pollster had recommended in order to turn public opinion against the Democrats' reform efforts.Journalists on the network's flagship news program, Special Report with Bret Baier, appear to have followed Sammon's directive in reporting on health care reform that evening.Sources familiar with the situation in Fox's Washington bureau have told Media Matters that Sammon uses his position as managing editor to ""slant"" Fox's supposedly neutral news coverage to the right. Sammon's ""government option"" email is the clearest evidence yet that Sammon is aggressively pushing Fox's reporting to the right -- in this case by issuing written orders to his staff.As far back as March 2009, Fox personalities had sporadically referred to the ""government option.""Two months prior to Sammon's 2009 memo, Republican pollster Frank Luntz appeared on Sean Hannity's August 18 Fox News program. Luntz scolded Hannity for referring to the ""public option"" and encouraged Hannity to use ""government option"" instead.Luntz argued that ""if you call it a 'public option,' the American people are split,"" but that ""if you call it the 'government option,' the public is overwhelmingly against it."" Luntz explained that the program would be ""sponsored by the government"" and falsely claimed that it would also be ""paid for by the government.""""You know what,"" Hannity replied, ""it's a great point, and from now on, I'm going to call it the government option.""[...]Sammon instructed staff to refer on air to ""government-run health insurance,"" the ""government option,"" ""the public option, which is the government-run plan,"" or -- when ""necessary"" -- ""the so-called public option"":From: Sammon, BillSent: Tuesday, October 27, 2009 8:23 AMTo: 054 -FNSunday; 169 -SPECIAL REPORT; 069 -Politics; 030 -Root (FoxNews.Com); 036 -FOX.WHU; 050 -Senior Producers; 051 -ProducersSubject: friendly reminder: let's not slip back into calling it the ""public option""1) Please use the term ""government-run health insurance"" or, when brevity is a concern, ""government option,"" whenever possible.2) When it is necessary to use the term ""public option"" (which is, after all, firmly ensconced in the nation's lexicon), use the qualifier ""so-called,"" as in ""the so-called public option.""3) Here's another way to phrase it: ""The public option, which is the government-run plan.""4) When newsmakers and sources use the term ""public option"" in our stories, there's not a lot we can do about it, since quotes are of course sacrosanct."

DISE	Effective doctors	I live in Portland, Oregon area and am wondering if anyone else on this list has a recommendation for a doctor in this area? I am looking for any doctors that specialize in mood disorders or bipolar disorder. I feel like I need both a psycho pharmacologist and psychologist.As an alternative, does anyone have a long distance (over the phone) relationship with a doctor? It occurs to me that if doctors were willing to do this, you could greatly enhance the possibility of finding a good doctor-patient relationship. Heck, in this day you could even fairly easily have a camera setup where the doc could see you while you talk.I feel like I'm finally starting to accept the realities of this illness in regards to seeing the necessity of having a good team setup with doctors. I can see that this team is essential for me to do well, but I'm not having an easy time finding the help that I need. I'm currently working with a nurse practitioner that specializes in mental health, but feel that this situation is inadequate, plus I have no real counseling to help sort things out.All the best.

To my knowledge this is the third time I have had it but this time seems to be the worst. The area starts to really itch then turns into little pimples. Nothing OTC seems to help. The only relief I have is if I dot nailpolish over it. Seems to help. The rash is in the arm pit, chest, back, under the breast, sides of torso and is working it's way down. Some have already appeared in groin area and legs. I may have one on my head! Please help me find some sort of relief and a way to get rid of this! Years ago when I had a similar breakout I went to a dermatologist. He didn't know what it was either but said it may be viral. Suggested that I had a cut on the body which got an infection in it whicj=h may have caused the breakout. He gave me some scripts and topical lotions. Those helped very little and the rash eventually went away but it took months. Please help!
FAML	Behavioral Problems in Hi IQ 8 year old	"My grandson has had behavioral problems in school and at home since approximately age 3.     He ran away from preschool at age 3. He is now 8 years old and his public school is at their wits end with him and it's only the first week of school.    Some things that are noteworthy:    His IQ is 197. He has bitten his left hand in the soft fleshy part below his thumb and index finger since age 2 and has a large (size of a 50 cent piece) scar there.    As a small boy he would shudder while biting his hand.    He continues to bit his hand occasionally but not to the point of creating an open wound as in the past and the shuddering has stopped. He claims he must do it to feel better and it doesn't hurt because there is no feeling there, presumably because it is all scar tissue now.    This middle child can be a ""good boy"" in one-on-one situations; however, when with his 3 year old little sister and his 10 year old sister he is usually starting fights.    He ""attacks"" his older sister on the school bus -- hitting, kicking and name calling.    She is embarrassed to be his sister in school. He was sent to the principle's office the first week of school for threatening a classmate that if she didn't ""shut up"" he was going to jam a pencil down her throat.    His school work is sloppy and he hates school.    I contend he is not being challenged sufficiently and should be in a gifted school program, probably at a private school.    Additionally, the parents are working with a doctor on neurological issues they hope will stop the hand biting.    He's been to many counselors and none do any good. . . he disrespects them all and they give up.    He tells his older sister, ""I like to see how far I can push adults.""    Any suggestions, PLEASE.This discussion is related toWhat is a normal IQ in children."

DISE	Eating while sleeping	"Hello!Over the past few years, I have begun to eat in my sleep.    This started off to be a rarity or a fluke about 3-4 years ago but as of recently it's become more frequent ie a few times a week. I'm also experiencing nightmares and dialing the phone in my sleep and bad headaches.My biggest concern is the eating in my sleep because it can cause me harm if it gets worse. This started off as a joke or a minor irratation and now it's embarrassing and makes me feel like a pig.    I'm also always exhausted because of not ever getting a good night sleep or feel well rested.I frequently will remember waking up in the middle of the night but not remember why I ate what I choose or going back to sleep.    My ""snacks"" are often chips, or salty crunchy items and a lot of them, ie a half bag. If there is left over pizza or mexican food I am likely to eat that. I've gotten up in the morning still with food in my mouth and have found snacks in my bed or empty bags of snacks on my floor. I've tried to not keep the food in the house or ""hide"" it or create obstacles like shutting the door to my bedroom or child proofing a cabinet and it doesn't seem to work.    Do you have any advice?    If I keep up like this, I'll never fit into my wedding gown! or keep my job!Thanks!"

DEMO	Itchy swollen feet right before period	In April during a 5 hour car trip my feet became very itchy- it itched them and they became red and swollen in areas. The whole foot was not swollen: but certain parts became itchy and red- under toes, sides of feet, a little on top- no ankle swelling or redness.    These itchy red areas become hard and painful to walk, the outbreaks last about 24-48 hours.    The first time this happened I passed it off to wearing new and cheap high heals for over 13 hours the day before (I teach).    That day I also had some trouble with a family member who was staying with me- so I felt stress may have been a contributor?However, about 3 weeks later this happened againÃ¢ € ¦ and I went off to the doctorÃ¢ € ™s.    The swelling doesnÃ¢ € ™t occur in the same area each Ã¢ € œoutbreakÃ¢ € - however the onset is always the same, itchy, red, turns hard, becomes painful.    My family doctor looked at my like I was crazy for being concerned; I am a healthy 24 year old.    However, this has happened since April 4 more times.    It has happened right (one-two days) before menstrual cycle in May, June and now July- I am not pregnant.I have seen a podiatrist- who took xrays and did blood work (I know the blood work was for lupus and arthritic counts but not sure the scope of the tests).    He concluded my foot is mis-shaped and molded orthotics for me.    However, this has happened two more times- I am trying to understand what is triggering this as nothing relieves the swelling, itchiness or pain.As I have tracked these episodes they donÃ¢ € ™t seem to happen with any certainty- meaning I have tracked my physical activity (I workout a lot), bought and wear 4X Width cross trainer shoes- even to work, and the only pattern that exists with these outbreaks is many of them are occurring right before I begin my period.    Could this be a part of PMS? They checked my blood pressure at the doctors all times I have been there- the only other thing I can think of is a circulation problem- sometimes the pain travels up to my calves (feels very sore like the day after a hard workout).    But at this point I feel like I am guessing with no guidance?

GOAL	Extreme jaw pain 2 weeks after gum grafting surgery	I had gum grafting surgery 2 weeks ago, and although most paitents are back to work or school the next day, I had several problems. For the first 4 days after surgery, my face swelled up like a balloon!    I had bruising around my jowls and under my eyes from the swelling.    When the doctor took out the packing, the swelling went down quickly, but then the jaw pain started.    I was having a lot of pain around in the area of the gums but also in my jaw on one side.    Stranger still, I had only had the surgery on the top but the jaw pain is on the top and bottom.    When i reported this to my doctor he prescribed an antibiodic and vicoden for the pain.    He told me to call back if the pain was not completely gone.    I called back in a couple of days and reported that my gums felt better (but not great), but the pain in my jaw was unbearable.    He just prescribed more vicoden and told me that some people take longer to heal.    It has been two weeks and I am really getting concerned.    Is this part of the healing process or should I seek medical treatment from someone else?    If so, who?    Thanks for any advice you can give me.
FAML	Sleeping with 14 year old son, appropiate or not?	"Hello, I just have a question pertaining to my GF and her 14 year old son. She has been a single Mom for half of her son's life and then got married when the boy was at age seven (Her ex-husband was not his biological father). Obviously she has now gotten a divorce and we met early on in her seperation from her ex-husband (alittle over a year ago). I have noticed that on occassion her 14 year old boy sleeps with her whenever I'm not there (I work nights four days out of a week) and recently - in the last week or two - this behavior has somewhat increased. He has slept with her probably three or four nights that I haven't been there over that time frame. I feel uncomfortable with that situation occurring, mainly because of the child's age but also because neither one of them (especially my GF) seem uncomfortable with it. Furthering more background to this is the fact that the boy is more sexualized for his age then some other kids that I know in his age group. Also in her previous relationship with her ex-husband, the boy would try and sleep together with them and be forced by the ex-husband to sleep on the floor in their bedroom, right up until the boy was roughly 12-13 years old, when finally he slept in his own room. Finally, my GF did confide in me that one night last summer, he did enter her (our) room and tried to ""imitate"" me while she was sleeping - talking in a low voice, calling her by her name rather than as just ""Mom"" and some other things that I did find disturbing. I feel that I'm not over-reacting to this and I haven't brought it up with her yet, but feel that maybe alittle honest feedback would help me before I decide on what my next action should or shouldn't be."
FAML	Need your advice with 7 yrs old boy please Ã¢Â€Â¦	His mom is my friend who is a single mom, and he is my god-son.    He didnÃ¢ € ™t listen and even hit her sometimes; therefore, she asked me to help her by taking care of him.    Five months ago, he moved in with us and called my husband Ã¢ € œdaddyÃ¢ €  and me Ã¢ € œmommyÃ¢ € ; however, we let him talks to his real mom every night.He was very good for the first few weeks, but then he has been really bad lately.    He doesnÃ¢ € ™t seem to listen to us and his teachers.    He talks too much in class that his teachers have to create a weekly behavior chart for him, but it doesnÃ¢ € ™t seem to work because he still talks anyway.    I asked him why, he told us that because he wanted to tell people things.    The teachers complained and called us several times a month because of his misbehavior.    Then yesterday, he got into a fight with one of the boys on the bus just because that boy stared at him.    We asked him what and why that happened.    He told us that he hit that boy because he didnÃ¢ € ™t like the way that boy looked at him.    We explained to him why he should not do that, but he kept telling us that he just didnÃ¢ € ™t like the way that boy looked at him.And, he doesnÃ¢ € ™t want to study at all and lies about everything.    He keeps making excuses so that he doesnÃ¢ € ™t have to read and study.    WeÃ¢ € ™ve talked to him, but he keeps giving us more lies.    Everyday, we talk to him, help him with school, tell him that we love him and hug him, Ã¢ € ¦.., and even spank him.    We have tried all the things that we know, but none of them working.    Please helpÃ¢ € ¦..    Thanks very much!

The black specks have only appeared in the last few weeks, but the dark patches have been gradually getting bigger over a period of two years.    Can you please advise if this is anything to be concerned about?
GOAL	Marinated Asparagus	Another great asparagus recipe.Fresh asparagus2 tbsp. red wine vinegar1 tbsp. finely chopped shallot1/4 cup canola oil2 tbsp. extra virgin olive oil2 tbs. chopped mixed herbs (tarragon, chervil, chives, parsley, basil, thyme)salt & ground pepperBring a large pot of water to a raging boil.    Line up tips of asparagus and trimoff tough fibrous bases.    Please asparagus in small batches into well salted boiling water.    Cook until asparagus is bright green and still has some crunch (1 - 3 minutes).    Never try to cook too many at one time as the water must come back to a boil quickly after the asparagus is added.Immediately plunge into an ice bath to stop cooking (1 minute or else will become waterlogged and tasteless).    Drain.Combine red wine vinegar & shallots in a bowl.    Whisk in oils & season with salt and pepper.    Toss some vinaigrette onto the asparagus (can marinate for a while).    Add herbs just before serving.Note:    I keep these in the fridge and just keep munching.    Addictive.    The marinade is also good on tough meats.

SOCL	Policy differences take center stage in first presidential debate	"http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/10/03/14207942-policy-differences-take-center-stage-in-first-presidential-debate?litePolicy largely trumped Ã¢ € œzingersÃ¢ €  in the first debate between President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney as the two sparred on issues as varied as taxes and spending, entitlements, education and more.Romney sought to cast himself as a capable and affable alternative to the sitting president and looked to establish himself as presidential in a major opportunity to reach voters in a side-by-side setting at the University of Denver. Hitting that mark was especially important for Republican presidential nominee, given the high expectations he had faced entering tonightÃ¢ € ™s forum, having trailed Obama in most polls before this event.President Barack Obama shakes hands with Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney after the first presidential debate at the University of Denver, Wednesday, Oct. 3, 2012, in Denver.Obama, for his part, cast his Republican opponent as elusive in specifying just how he would cut taxes without adding to the national debt, or what form his own health care reforms would take.But neither candidate seemed to achieve any breakout moment, and two additional debates throughout October could prove more pivotal to the electionÃ¢ € ™s outcome.Taxes and spending dominated the outset of the debate, as Obama and Romney battled largely over the details of RomneyÃ¢ € ™s tax proposals, which call for an across-the-board, 20 percent reduction in each marginal tax rate. The Republican argues the cost of these would be offset by reducing deductions.""My number one principle is there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit,"" Romney said.Romney asserted his tax plan would spur job creation and help balance the budget, but the president insisted that these proposals simply do not add up.In the final push in the 2012 presidential election, candidates Mitt Romney and Barack Obama make their last appeals to voters.""The fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class,"" Obama said. ""It's math. It's arithmetic.""With a few exceptions, both candidates largely avoided the snappy, practiced lines that sometimes come to define debates. Their discussion at many times overrode the objections of moderator Jim Lehrer, and some of the topics for debate had to be shortened or cut altogether to accommodate for the candidatesÃ¢ € ™ long-windedness.In a time-honored debate tradition, both campaignsÃ¢ € ™ surrogates declared victory for their candidate of choice. But style for both Obama and Romney seemed as important of a factor as any specific answer.Romney entered the debate needing to make up ground versus Obama, and the matchup this evening offered voters their first chance to make a direct comparison between the two of them. The Republican nominee also sought to soften his tone in many respects, a bow toward the net-negative personal approval rating he suffers in many polls.Obama campaign manager Jim Messina told reporters following the debate that the presidentÃ¢ € ™s long-windedness was Ã¢ € œnever going to be our strong suit,Ã¢ €  and acknowledged that Romney had scored Ã¢ € œstyle points.Ã¢ € Ã¢ € œThis is a race to 270 electoral votes,Ã¢ €  Messina said. Ã¢ € œIn states like Ohio and Virginia and Florida, RomneyÃ¢ € ™s positions on tax cuts and Medicare are going to be real problems for him. And he doubled down on those all night.Ã¢ € But Obama didnÃ¢ € ™t score a knockout punch against Romney, declining to employ the controversial video about the Ã¢ € œ47 percentÃ¢ €  of Americans whose votes the GOP nominee had essentially dismissed. Obama declined to talk about RomneyÃ¢ € ™s record at Bain Capital or the personal income tax rate paid by Romney Ã¢ € “ two major, effective lines of attack used by the Democratic campaign over the summer.NBC's David Gregory, Savannah Guthrie and Chuck Todd provide analysis immediately following the first 2012 presidential debate between GOP nominee Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama.Romney also parried many of the presidentÃ¢ € ™s attacks by largely embracing the essence of many of ObamaÃ¢ € ™s own policies Ã¢ € “ from health care to education and regulation Ã¢ € “ while emphasizing the areas in which the two of them differed.Romney said he supports repealing the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory reform law, but replacing it with an alternative of his own. He has said that about immigration, and defused a briar patch involving his and ObamaÃ¢ € ™s similar health care plans by seizing upon process.Ã¢ € œI like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together,Ã¢ €  said Romney. Ã¢ € œWhat you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote.Ã¢ € Toward the end of the debate, Obama struck back by questioning whether RomneyÃ¢ € ™s own promises were too good to be true.Ã¢ € œAt some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Gov. Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they're too good?Ã¢ €  Obama asked.The immediate fallout of the debate will be most quickly reflected in media cycles on Thursday and into the weekend, though it might take daysÃ¢ € ™ worth of polling to identify whether tonightÃ¢ € ™s debate moved the needle.Obama and Romney will next meet Oct. 16 for the second of three debates. Before then, Vice President Joe Biden and Republican vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan will debate next Thursday in Kentucky."
DEMO	Did my birth control make me sick?	"Hello, thank you for reading and answering my questions.I am 34 years old.    In my early to mid twenties, I took Ortho Tri Cyclen for birth control.    In my late twenties, I was told by my physician to stop because she had discovered that I have Lupus.    I was told that BC pills can negatively affect an autoimmune disease because of the hormones.    For about 6 or 7 years now, I have used condoms to prevent pregnancy.Also, until about a month and a half ago, I have never taken vitamins or supplements.    I started taking a B Complex vitamin and a 5 HTP supplement.    I've done very well with them and can tell a difference in my energy.Recently, I was told that I absolutely do not have Lupus, and that it is probably Fibromyalgia.    My gyno said it was safe to return to Ortho Tri Cylcen, but gave me the Lo version.    I was on it for only six days when I started developing these symptoms:I developed nausea that lasted about 24 hours during which I did vomit once.Right before I vomited, I felt a quick wave of escalating heat come over me that didn't subside until a few minutes after vomiting.I believe it is important to note that this nausea and vomiting felt totally unlike any type of virus, it felt different and very, very strange.I cried for hours afterward because I couldn't stand feeling like this.I stopped the pills that Saturday, the sixth day, and spoke to my gyno on Monday.    She said to stop completely and we could try something different after my next period.    But she didn't give me any explanations as this was a quick telephone call.Right around the time I started this birth control, I also switched my vitamins.    I stopped the B Complex, and started a Multi Vitamin that included the same amount of B Complex, plus, obviously, lots of everything else.I've been off the birth control for about 5 days, and I have been on the Multi vitamin for about a week and a half.Last night, I woke up as the same quick wave of heat was coming over me.    I could feel it passing over my body and I could feel my temperature rise.    Everything I've read about a menopausal hot flash seems to fit what I felt.I had the same nausea and vomited within a few minutes.    It felt the same as before as well.Just like before, I returned back to normal after having vomited.So, my questions are:Do you think I'm actually experiencing ""hot flashes?""    I'm only 34.Are they related to the birth control and/or the multi vitamin?Can a birth control pill trigger pre-menopause?Is there a relation between a possible auto immune disease and these types of symptoms while on BC?Can multi vitamins make a person nauseous?Do you think the BC and/or the multi vitamin, or the combination of them, is causing the symptoms I'm having?Most importantly,When will this go away if it's related to the BC?    I don't know how much longer I can endure this.    Shouldn't the pills be out of my system by now?Again, thank you for taking time to read and answer.    I appreciate it. f"

FAML	7 yr old son exploration	My 7 year old recently made a comment to his neighbors (boys) suggesting that they pull the underwear down of another 4 yr old girl neighbor and to spank her bottom. Then soon after this comment was made, he was at her home and the girls mother found him in her closet with his pants down, alone. She told me that her daughter told her that my son pulls her in bushes. I have also been told that he explained to other children that the way you have sex is to be naked and to lay on top of one another and to kiss.I am very concerned. I know that we have caught him watching inapropriate sexual scenes on cable tv that we immediately blocked. He has also experimented with typing on the internet search words such as butt or boobs, etc. I am so embaressed and scared. I worry that what he is doing is a problem and I do not know how to erase the thoughts from his mind. I also am worried about how his self esteem will be effected by the fact that my neighbors have told him he is not allowed to play with their children or come in their yard or home. I almost want to move away. What can I do to help him correct this issue and help him with the rejection he is getting as a result of his behavior?

FAML	Update	We ended up pulling our DD from her school instead of fighting it out for 8 weeks. We felt that someone had to end the drama so it might as well be us.

We have lots of exciting plans for her after we move. I've already spoken to a couple potential schools and found one that we think would suit her really well.

GOAL	Change in computer rx but not distance?	Hello, I am currently have 2 pairs of glasses one is for distance -4OD & -5 OS and a computer pair -2 OD & -2.5 OS.    I just went and saw my Opthalmologist because I felt my vision was a bit worse than before, he checked it and said there was no needed change in my distance Rx, but I explained that with my computer pair, I see more clearly out of the right eye if I tilt the glasses forward to an angle, so he said that means i need a weaker lens, so he bumped up my computer Rx to -2.5OD and -3OS, does this sound right, also how does it happen that my computer Rx would change, but my distance RX would be the same?    Thanks for your help!

DEMO	Wife bleeding during climax???	"Not sure if topic area is correct. Anyway, several months ago my wife discovered she had a cyst on one of her ovaries (she was in for a bad bladder infection). The Doc said it didn't look like anything to worry about. She now has insurance and plans to get it checked out anyways. She has complained on and off lately about a slight pain or discomfort in her abdomen that comes and goes. Her periods seem to be on track except for every time she thinks she's done and we have sex, she bleeds some more for another day then she's done (she says I always find her ""secret pocket"" and knock it loose). =P She began her period around the 15th and over the last few days we have had alot of ""doggie style"" sex along with her complaining of the same abdominal discomfort. The discomfort went away a couple of days ago, but last night during sex while she was climaxing, I looked down and noticed blood beginning to appear on my penis. It seemed to be quite a bit- more than when I find her ""secret pocket"". She has been off the pill for a couple of months (we're trying to get pregnant). Could this be because of the cyst or could it be implantation bleeding? From what I've read it's probably not implantation, but it would be nice to know that it was instead of something detrimental! Anyone have a clue? -Thanks"
TRMT	BPA is bad for you	"Dear Reader,BPA is bad for you.There. I'll go out on a limb and just say it.Your turn, FDA.Less than perfectIn a perfect world we wouldn't do things backwards.In a perfect world the first person to smoke tobacco might wonder: ""Could inhaling smoke into my lungs hurt me?"" And then, before going ahead to create a massive, international industry, he would conduct some tests to see if smoking might be a highly addictive habit that shortens life in the most hideous ways.But that's not our style.Here in Real World, scientists first synthesized bisphenol A (BPA) in the late 1800s. About 40 years later it was found to have estrogenic properties. A few years later, scientists figured ways to use BPA in making plastic containers and resins that now line most food and soft drink cans.ButÃ¢ € ¦uh ohÃ¢ € ¦BPA polymer decays over time, so traces of the synthetic estrogen are released into canned foods and baby formula in plastic bottles. (BPA is also used to make pacifiers, plastic forks and spoons, plastic bowls, etc.)By the time researchers started studying the effects of BPA on animals, use of the chemical was in full swing. And wouldn't you know it Ã¢ € “ the animal tests suggested that BPA might not be real healthy. In fact, it might be real unhealthy, prompting reproductive and hormone-related problems.But those results were in a bunch of mice. What about humans?This past summer, FDA officials handed down their judgment: No problem! Let the BPA good times roll!But the party came to a sudden halt last month when a Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) study concluded that high urinary BPA concentrations might be linked to increased risk of heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and abnormal concentrations of liver enzymes. (According to a Columbia University scientist, more than 90 percent of Americans have detectable levels of BPA in their urine.)One doctor told ABC News: ""If this does not close the door on the use of BPA in consumer products, I don't know what will.""That's adorable.Here's a more reliable take, from a JAMA editorial: ""One factor that may be contributing to the refusal of regulatory agencies to take action on BPA in the face of overwhelming evidence of harm from animal studiesÃ¢ € ¦is an aggressive disinformation campaign using techniques ('manufactured doubt') first developed by the lead, vinyl, and tobacco industries to challenge the reliability of findings published by independent scientists.""And that's reality. And that's why the FDA will do nothing at all to protect the public from the use of BPA. There's just too much money involved.Do tellSo forget about the FDA riding to the rescue. This one is up to us. What's needed now is some Water Cooler Regulation. That is: Spread the word. Tell your family, tell your friends, tell your coworkers Ã¢ € “ BPA is bad stuff.Parents can find information about alternatives to BPA products for infants and younger kids at these websites: thesoftlanding.com, and zrecommends.com.And everyone can steer clear of BPA by avoiding as many foods as possible that come in cans and plastic containers.

FAML	My 6 year old son behavior	My 6 year old son recently started peeing his pants randomly throughout the day. I never catch him doing it until he is done and I find the wet clothes or notice he has changed in to a new outfit. The other day we were watching tv together and I dosed off to wake up to him standing by the closet peeing on the floor. His attitude has also changed drastically. He has become very mouthy and talks back to everything I ask him to do. At this point I have tried yelling, taking away tv and outside time with his friends but nothing seems to be working! I'm actually very concerned its beginning to stress me out and I have become extremely emotional. His father and I have been seperated for going on 2 years now and I have been seeing the same guy on and off for about that long as well until recently we made it official. His father has stopped coming around because of his own selfish reasons and I know it hurts him even though he just doesn't show it. I really don't know what to do please help.

SOCL	To let go!	The situation in a nutshell -1) been in an intimate relationship for 2 years being fully aware that it couldn't go 'anywhere' because of our age difference (19years - me, female, being older)2) he finds out I'm chatting to someone else, his heart breaks3) he finds someone else, I say too soon - it's a rebound4) 3 months later she falls pregnant, now she's a knocked-up rebound - he will take full responsibility as a dad5) he portrays to be the committed partner to her however he still wants to be intimate with me6) they don't have a healthy 'relationship' (sexual or emotional)7) he's a substance abuser and probably suffers from an OCD8) she comes from a broken home, no real family support - her mom is not active in her life, only her gran9) his mum is fully involved with his life and will be stricter when baby comes - totally anti alcohol10)I am so disappointed in him now, he can't follow his dreams as much as he'd like to.    Do I just 'cut' myself off from the situation and walk away ... it's almost like I cannot see him 'waste' his life and in the same breath, it's not like I see myself with him for the rest of my life.Is this just pity that I feel??

GOAL	surgery for achalasia after bariatric surgery	"I had bariatric surgery almost 5 years ago (subtotal gastrectomy only) and shortly afterward discovered that it seems to have ""unmasked"" achalasia. I surmise that I had this condition since birth, with repeated hospitalizations for removal of objects that got stuck in my esophagus until age 11 when I had a dilation and symptoms subsided enough that I did not have to be hospitalized again...still occasionally choked on food but eventually it passed through. The condition was never explained to me probably because of my age when most events happened.When I decided to have bariatric surgery I even requested the surgeon dilate a esophageal stricture, which he did during the surgery. Subsequently I have had worsening achalasia symptoms, have seen motility specialist and got the diagnosis and started to learn more. Without going in to more details, it has become necessary for me to have surgery to correct the achalasia. My question is what special considerations are there for me having a Heller myotomy, since I have virtually no stomach remaining (just a 60 or so cc tube-stomach). Are there very many instances of this surgery being done after subtotal gastrectomy? What problems might arise (above and beyond normal surgically related problems). Are there any case series of people in my situation in the medical literature that I might read? Would my potential outcome or risk be substantially different from someone with a ""normal"" stomach?Am I asking the right questions? Are there other questions I should be asking when I find a potential surgeon? Is there someone in the San Francisco bay area with substantial expertise in both bariatric surgery and the GI surgery I need?"

FAML	Normal Behavior in 3-Year-Old?	My three-year-old son throws a huge tantrums several times a day.    For instance, we are serving X for lunch, and he wants Y, and we say he needs to have a few bites of X before we can have Y, and he throws a huge tantrum. These tantrums have gone on as long as 1 1/2    hours, and they are making us miserable. He won't give in or budge; he's incredibly inflexible.and uncompromising. I know he's only three, but his 5-year-old brother has Asperger's, so of course we worry that he might have a tinge of something. He also has separation anxiety at his preschool and doesn't want me to leave; he usually cries when I do go but then the teachers say later that he has had a good day.My questions are these: Is this normal three-year-old behavior? Will he become more flexible as he matures? How do we encourage greater flexibility? And how do we handle these tantrums? In general, we stick to our guns about what we've requested of him, and he sticks to his guns, so it becomes a monumental battle of wills.
FAML	Bossy 5 Year Old Hitting His Mother and Sister	I have a 5 year old son who is a wonderful, respectful and caring boy, 80% of the time. During the remaining 20% of the time, he is disrespectful, angry, moody, and yelling at my 13 year daughter and myself as much as possible. He turns red in the face. He punches. He puts his face right in mine and tries to bully me around. I remain as calm as possible. His behaviour starts whenever he doesn't get his way. My daughter never behaved this way, so it's very difficult for me to understand how to handle him, or how to react to his behaviour. I have no experience. Every day we run into problems. I would appreciate help and advice because this situation has drained me emotionally and made me quite sad.

FAML	Did he make me dependent on him/or was it me	I am 42 yr female who was in arelationship for 5yrs,when we met we both liked to entertain,party,and have a bottle of wine between us every night,as time went on my partner would increase the amount of alcohol he brought home from 1 bottle to 2, to 3 etc, i found myself drinking as much as he was although i could never handle it like him,he semed to keep it together,i would blank out/pass out etc,this went on for the first 2yrs of our relationship,there were so many arguments every night (which i always seemed to get the blame of next day,even though i knew he had thrown me out into the garden,into tables,thrown on the floor etc,trying to tell him this he just said i slipped and fell as i was soo drunk.We did throw him out numerous times but things he said would get better,so i'd let him back in,then i found out i was pregnant with my now 2 yr old son whom i luv very much,through my pregnancy i never touched a drop and for 6 mths after although my partner did by himself,but even more when he had a friend or 2 round. I did start to have a couple with him but again its gradually got more and more like before and the pushing ,shoving,verbal started again,and as usual its all my fault as i was too drunk,and fell on the floor etc, last week i ended up with a burst chin,he said i fell but i know i was pushed. I just think to myself why does he make out everything is all my doing,is it to take the spotlight off himself ?? I feel i gradually got in a rut and dependent on alcohol in this relationship,now I am on my own and havent touched a drophe however is still having a couple and is living elsewhere,he keeps sayin that we should get back together but i know it wouldnt work as it would all start all over again,just thinking did he keep toppin mine up all the time to take the spotlight of himself,or did i have sum kinda problem.

PREG	OT, but any suggestions?	My MIL called me last night from the hospital and they admitted her because of hernias. She has already had like 12 hernia repair surgeries. Her normal surgeon that had done all the other ones told her that he would not do it because she is to high risk (diabetic) and that she is too fat!! Doctors words!! You are too fat. Are you kidding me??My MIL is 4'11'' and she has breasts that weigh about 35 lbs apeice. Her family doc has written multipul letters to Title 19 (she is on disability because of the hernias) to try to get them to pay for a breast reduction. They refuse! For some reason they would rather keep paying for hernia surgeries than eliminate the main cause of them.My question is....is there anything that any of you ladies know about that we would be able to do to get her that reduction?? I would pay for it if I had the money, but unfortunately, I don't. I know it's completely OT but right now I am desperate to help this wonderful woman out.Thank You!!

DISE	Pain Question	"Hi,    I'm new here and I had made another post in a different section that went unanswered I hope it doesn't happen to this one.I have been dealing with pain in my joints and SEVERE headaches and inguinal hernias due to a rare connective tissue disorder (Ehlers-Danlos) I have some vascular involvement and extreme hyper-mobility in my joints and have dislocations all the time in most of my joints (elbows, shoulders, ankles, especially my hips because when they reset they SLAM down on a nerve or something and I can feel it shoot down my leg like a freakin lightning bolt ) of my joints.    I was just given a referral to a pain management doctor after this diagnosis was made and all the tests were run.In the meantime I have been put on 5/325 Norco which do a decent job of getting rid of the pain, and anyone that has had chronic pain for a very long time knows that even ""decent"" reduction in pain is like a godsend.    However, I was told by my geneticist that the first step was going to be to find the right combination of medication to completely kill the pain, not just reduce it but 100% kill the pain, with this news came a mixed feeling of joy and apprehension.What I am worried about is, the last thing in the world I want is to be stuck on narcotic pain medication for the rest of my life ( I'm only 22! ), but given the choice between narcotic pain medication and the pain I've been in since I was 8, I'll take my chances with the medication.    I would like to know if anyone has ever been told similar news ""First step is to find the right combination of medication to kill the pain completely"", and what was done, and again if god forbid I am stuck on this medication, how I fight becoming addicted.    Anything else that may be helpful to me would also be great..I would very much appreciate input of any kind as I am very very new to doctors and this whole... ""process"" and am somewhat scared about certain aspects of all this.Thank you very much."

SOCL	itchy red penis	"I will just very quickly summarize the condtion of the shaft of my penis as of late. I noticed an extreme    inflammation occur once a few months ago after I cleaned my house which coincided with a rather severe allergy attack on the shaft of my penis. It has since never ""healed""; I had tracts of skin more or less shed straight off of the penis, which would then appear glossy, with a thin layer of clear filmy liquid covering the exposed area. The whole shaft also occasionally goes through intense periods of itching. Recently, small red, circular dots have appeared on the head, which come and go, wax and wane in their visibilty. The skin on the entire shaft seems to come off with just slight provocation. I have almost lost the ability to come to an erection (the penis' itching gets too intense to contiinue with masturbation). Also, when slightly erect, it has a tendencey to kind of veer to the left, and    the disinction between the head and shaft seems less apparent, almost as if they are moulding together.I have been tested for all STDs and have come up negative...I explained all these problems to a local pharmacist who told me not to worry, that this was all due to some kind of fungal infection. He directedme to apply Lamisil on the area twice or once a day for four weeks. I must say that I believe I've noticed some improvement (the itching has ceased), but I still can't help but worry and am wondering if more drastic measures are needed. The penis still has no problem with its basic functions, i.e. urinating and ejaculating (which I've all but ceased anyway due to problems detailed in above). Can anyone help, or has anyone had a similar experience? I'm reluctant to go to a doctor.Thanks!"
DISE	Abrasion on head of penis, scrotum itch	Every so often, usually after sex and sometimes after a lot of masturbating, I get an abrasion on the same spot on the head of my penis.    The spot gets bruised and sore.    The spot gets red and sometimes expands for 5-7 days and heals if I don't masturbate or have sex in the meantime.    It looks like a rug burn and I usually shrug it off because I had been having sex or masturbating a lot.This time, the skin under my scrotum itches like crazy.    Am I paranoid or is this something to worry about?    Last time I was tested, I was negative for STIs.

I know you guys can't speak in absolutes, but what should I look out for?-Is a small change in cobweb floater number or motion ok or something to worry about?-Are the pepper (blood cell) floaters primarily the ones to worry about?-Is an occasional flash ok, or should any flash be checked out?-Are ""bad"" flashes persistent, meaning they start and don't stop or intermittent?-are these flashes something very defined in position or do they fill the whole field?Basically, when to worry?

SOCL	With Texas win, Romney secures delegates to win nomination	"http://nbcpolitics.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/05/29/11941848-with-texas-win-romney-secures-delegates-to-win-nomination?liteUpdated 9:45 p.m. ET -- Mitt Romney won the Republican primary in Texas on Tuesday, a victory that gives him more than the 1,144 delegates needed to secure his party's presidential nomination.Following a bruising primary season earlier this year that extended longer than many Republicans had hoped, NBC News projected that Romney had finally won the necessary delegates to secure the nomination, though the former Massachusetts governor wonÃ¢ € ™t earn the official nod until August's Republican National Convention in Tampa.The race for the Republican nomination has been largely over since the April 3 primary in Wisconsin. Romney's win in that contest prompted the eventual withdrawals of his remaining rivals: Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich, and Ron Paul. It also hastened the onset of President Barack Obama's own re-election offensive versus Romney.""I am honored that Americans across the country have given their support to my candidacy and I am humbled to have won enough delegates to become the Republican Party's 2012 presidential nominee,"" Romney said in a statement Tuesday evening. ""Our party has come together with the goal of putting the failures of the last three and a half years behind us.""Romney spent the evening at a closed-doors fundraiser in Las Vegas with Gingrich and reality television star Donald Trump.While conservatives appear to have rallied behind the former Massachusetts governor, the long campaign season was not without its consequences for Romney.The Republican has been fundraising aggressively to make up for money spent during the nomination battle, which depleted, in part, his relative financial parity versus Obama.Appearing at a campaign event is Las Vegas, GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney tells supporters that he will focus on putting Americans back to work if he is elected president.But more significantly, the Obama campaign has been turning some of the most stinging attacks on Romney from other Republicans and revived them for use in the general election.""I have no illusions about the difficulties of the task before us. But whatever challenges lie ahead, we will settle for nothing less than getting America back on the path to full employment and prosperity,"" Romney said in his victory statement. ""On November 6, I am confident that we will unite as a country and begin the hard work of fulfilling the American promise and restoring our country to greatness.Ã¢ € Case-in-point: the Obama campaign has spent much of the past two weeks attacking Romney's experience at Bain Capital, the private equity firm Romney had co-founded. That is a line of attack first advanced by Gingrich and Texas Gov. Rick Perry in January.Romney's continued advantage versus Obama, though, lies with an economic recovery that still rests on precarious footing.May's NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll found that half of Americans judged last month's jobs report as unsatisfactory. That dampened optimism for a recovery -- and, in turn, for Obama -- could become a potent political weapon for Romney, especially if continued economic unrest in Europe slows the pace of the recovery in the U.S"

GOAL	Chronic pain and sensitivity after fixed bridges. Help please!	Hi,I had two fixed bridges installed two months ago (over my front teeth) . The sensitivity is improving, but when I lay down at night, I have bad headaches and toothaches. The pain often goes to my jaws.    I have seen my dentist twice about it: the first time, he took x-rays and he said that a 'ligament was widening' which may have precipitated an abcess(abscess). I hadn't been using the sensitivity toothpaste regularly so he instructed me to use it more often and continue flossing, etc, and come back in 2 weeks. I left and the pain continued, even with the toothpaste.    I went to the ER and a doctor prescribed penicillin and tramadol. I finished the penicillin, went back to the dentist yesterday and he said my x-rays look better. He slightly adjusted my bite on one side and said the contact may have been causing the pain. If the pain continues, he recommends that I get a root canal. I respect his professional opinion, but I am not comfortable making that decision yet. If I don't have an abcess(abscess)and my bite is correct, what is causing the pain? Will a root canal help? I am hesitant to go through the pain and expense of a root canal if it might not work. Could it be a TMJ issue? Any help is appreciated. Thank you.

Ive never bled this much before, but Im wondering if maybe this could be normal since i was 6 days late. and last month my period was 11 days and very very minimal, just kinda like watery spotting.

After radiation     he went to urologist to check whether decatherization can be done and also to check the prostate size. HE found that prostate size has reduced significantly . Urologist tried to remove the catheter . But he was unable to urinate and they had to put the catherter back.Now my question is how can we perform decatherization? what are the effects after that?

SOCL	Poll shows Americans want to see Romney's tax returns	"(CNN) Ã¢ € “ A majority of Americans say presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney should release income tax information beyond the two years he's already disclosed.The USA Today/Gallup survey showed 54% of those surveyed felt Romney should release tax returns from additional years, compared to 37% who said Romney should not release more returns.Romney has released his tax return from 2010, and an estimate for his 2011 information. He filed for an extension on submitting his taxes in April, and has vowed to release the full return when the documents are finalized and filed.Democrats, and some Republicans, have urged Romney to disclose more of his tax information. Democrats say additional returns will clear up questions about offshore accounts and his rate of income tax, while Republicans say it would be politically advantageous to disclose more information. President Barack Obama's campaign immediately blasted out the poll Thursday as an indication their campaign push is working.In Thursday's poll, 30% of self-identified Republicans said Romney should release more of his returns, compared to 75% of Democrats and 53% of Independents who said the same.The survey also showed respondents were divided on whether or not the tax return information was relevant to the campaign. Forty-seven percent said having more tax return information from Romney would be ""largely irrelevant"" to making a decision at the voting booth, compared to 44% who said the returns would provide """"legitimate information that helps voters make better decisions.""The Gallup/USA Today poll was taken by telephone on Wednesday from 539 adults. The sampling error was plus or minus 5 percentage points.SOURCE: http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/19/poll-shows-americans-want-to-see-romneys-tax-returns/"
FAML	tantrums in school	my 7yr old son has just gone into the first year juniors and has since had tantrum fits whenever he feels things arent going his way or doesnt want to do as he is asked. He has a new class teacher and a new head which are both new to the school both of which he likes. He simply decides when it suits to stamp his feet shouting and screaming and storm out of the room into another on his own and shout go away. He doesnt do this at home and has never done it in previuos years. i have been down every road possible grounding taking toys away threatening with naughty school the police and even guilt trips saying he is making me ill and i am going to have to go away to hospital. i have had favourite members of the family in to help with extra tuition as at first i thought it may be because he is behind in class and can see this and so is trying to disrupt the rest or even using it for attention. he has recently been excluded twice as a result for lashing out and accidentley hitting or kicking teachers, and i have on three fridays had a phone call to go and collect him early afternoon as he is not fit to be in school. I have made adoctors appointment but this isnt unfortunatley until next week when they are off school anyway, but i am really at the end and it is getting me down please help! p.s i am going about it a different way at the moment by saying ive had enough he doesnt care so neither do i which so far seems to have upset him (slightly) Thankyou Michelle

PREG	To many questions to just list one	Hi All,I've been trying to find a blog that seems down to Earth .... so....I'm 41 and have been trying for just over two years to start a family.    Long story short, on 7/5 I just had a four embryo transfer.    It's hard to talk about it with ones I know as they have never gone through this and I don't want to get to many friends/family involved if the news is . . .I am hopefull and extremely nervous.    I signed up for the risk of multiples but after going through the procdure, now I feel I could be starting my own small army.My first blood test is on7/16 -my husband's birthday =)Any advice?
FAML	aggresive 5 year old	I have a wonderful 5 year old child he is smart funny imaginative and loving.    But i just don't know what is going on with him.    He is very defiant, he argues with me about everything i tell him to do, he seems to think the rules don't apply to him.    He gets angry very easily and physically lashes out at other kids and my 7 year old daughter. He seems to meet qualifications for many disorders including add, odd, social anxiety disorder intermittant explosive disorder and possibly copbd.    I am taking him for a pysch eva, but i am afraid they may tell me to put him on medication which i am very hesitant to do.    Depression bi-polar, and anxiety disorders run rampant in my family.    I just want him to be happy, and to grow up having a happy fulfiling life.    I try not to spank as i think this reinforces agressive behavior, i have tried time out but he kicked his bedroom window out, flipped his tv off the dresser, and destroyed his room.    Recently our cat had kittens and one of them scratched him so he threw the kitten against the wall causing it to have a seizure and a broken leg.    I punished him by not allowing him to play in his baseball game the next day and not going outside for three days.    The thing that concerns me the most is that this is really not his nature. He is very kind, affectionate and loving, it seems almost like he suddenly turns into another kid. I try to stcik to my rules but every single thing with him is a battle.    I want him to go to counseling after his eval and he will recieve in school counseling in the fall. i would even like to take a parenting class for parents with difficult children.    Another thing that i think could possibly be related is he will only poop in his pants, he pees in the toilet just fine, but he will poop in his pants whenever wherever and he won't even tell me it happened he just goes on about his playing untill i smell him.    i have heard that kids to this as a form of control, but i don't understand why.    i took him to the doc. and he gave me a stool softner but he refuses to take it.    his sense of tasts and smell have always been very keen, and he can tell if i try to mix it in his juice or cereal.    I just wish i could help him and find out why he is so mad all of the time.

FAML	14 yr old hearing a voice	"Hi my son is 14. He has been on Prozac 20mg for over a yr. He mentioned about 3 wks ago that he was hearing a voice but could not tell me what it said. A few days ago he told me this again. He said the voice sounds like a demon and it is telling him to hurt himself and others. I took him to a mental health ER on Wed. He saw a nurse, a therrapist and a psychiatrist. The psychiatrist upped his Prozac to 40mg. He also said that males at this age who have depression symptoms sometimes experience this. He started the 40mg Prozac on Thurs. morning and says the voices are more frequent. Does any one have any suggestions or know how long we should wait for the Prozac to ""work"". He has an appointment with a therapist on Wed."

FAML	7 y/o daughter - daily frustration fits at home & school	"My daughter is in her third year of school (2nd grade) & we have received the same complaint from each teacher.    She is easily frustrated & subjects or problems which she may have been doing with ease for weeks can, on any given day, become a crisis.    Upon posing a problem (new or old) she will instantaneously cry out ""I can't do it!"", bury her head in her hands, & either cry, groan, stomp her feet, or throw herself on the floor (yes, even in the middle of her peers in the school room).    We, & the teachers, both agree she is a very bright girl & can do the hardest problems with ease when she isn't disposed to these fits.    Unfortunately, these outbursts seem to be increasing in frequency.    We moved from the U.S. to Europe in Sept 2006 immersing her in a Dutch school adding stress & pressures, and although they have increased recently she's portrayed this behavior from very early in life.    (FYI: She is now fluent, speaking & reading in both languages; the teacher admits better than most natives in her class.)    She has always had a tendency to want to do things perfect the first time and would rather stand at the back of her ballet class to watch the rest of the girls until the third - last class when she could join the dance with perfect choreography.    She is normally happy & pronounced bright & social by most, but anyone who tries to teach her something school related or otherwise will see her shut down followed by some temper tantrum.    Her teachers & parents are finally at their wits end.    We've both tried all spectrums from being overly sweet and understanding to getting angry and forcing her to do the problem.    Neither of these, nor anything in between have unlocked her brain or pulled her back to reason during these daily moments.What is this and how can we work her through it?"

DISE	High blood pressure onset	I work in a state mental facility in direct care.    This happened in November 2009.    One day while at work, I started to feeling really funky, so I had the LPN check my blood pressure, it was 195/95.    She has me if I had a headache or sick to my stomach, of which I replied no.    She said maybe it was from dealing with the individuals.    I said I had been on lunch break for 30 minutes.    She did check it a few more times the rest of the day.    A couple days later, while on my days off, it shot up again.    I ended up calling 911 and then the paramedics arrived they checked my blood pressure and it was 200/100.    He gave me some baby aspirin, a nitroglycerin and put me on oxygen and took me to the ER.    They did blood work, EKG, and the automatic blood pressure cuff, and every 15 minutes it would check my blood pressure, and would set off the alarm, it ranged between 165/80 to 170/80, after a few hours, the doctor came in and said there was nothing wrong to follow up with my regular doctor.    When I went in, they took my blood pressure and it was 190/120, he wanted to put me into the hospital, to get blood pressure down, but since it was thanksgiving weekend(thanksgiving day, the next day), unless I had a heart attack, they wouldn't do much.    He put me on Diovan 160 mg and Lopressor 25 mg, he then had me go to a heart doctor.    I had been keeping track of my blood pressure on a regular basis and when the heart doctor saw my readings(average 165/80)over the last 1.5 years, he doubled the Diovan and had me start taking the Lopressor 2 times a day, ran test, because of my blood pressure running so high for so long(I never thought much about it, because it was consistant).    He was concerned I would have an enlarged heart.    After all the test, he said my heart was slightly enlarged, I had an ascending aorta aneurysm, but it is not large enough to worry about and also have 2 leaky valves, but they are not leaking enough to worry about.    I have went to him on a regular basis, the last time I went, he said the aneurysm and the leaky valves have not gotten worse.    I had went on a low-sodium diet, back in November 2009 and I average around 1200-1300 mg sodium a day, my blood pressure has improved but it was in the high 120's/80 and he said he was toying with the idea of increasing my blood pressure medicine.    I also take a baby aspirin a day.    Now my question, my pulse runs 45 to 55, 90 % of the time.    It does get up to 70 to 80.    I do wear one of those chest straps that sends signal to my watch and one in a blue moon my pulse will get up to 90-100, but my average pulse for the day will still be around 55.    Could the aneurysm or leaky valves be causing this?    My co-workers have been really concerned, because of the low pulse and have had the LPN check my blood pressure/pulse.I have severe sleep apnea which I have tried the CPAP and the BiPAP with no success, also had the so-called sleep apnea surgery with no success.    I also had heart cauterization in September 2003, because of chest pains and was told them that I had a small amount of blockage, but everyone has a little.    This was by the same heart doctor that I am seeing now.I am 6' tall and weigh around 230 pounds, I know this is a little over weight, but have also been on a low-fat diet also.    I was up to 265 pounds in November 2009.
TRMT	Cirrhosis consistent with Hep C-induced disease; Grade 3, Stage 4	There are so many questions I have but the main one is, WHY IS IT THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN REFERRED FOR A LIVER TRANSPLANT?    Is it again an insurance issue?Because of the research I have done, I know that some people get really really sick before their liver fails, while others have no symptoms whatsoever, they just die one day.Since having to leave my state job due to illness (hep c) and going on disability medical I have had the worse care ever.    I continually get referred to a nurse instead of a doctor when going to a clinic; gastroenterology, liver, etc.    Doctors get paid so little when you are on disability, they don't even want to see you.    This is so unfair, I worked all my life to end up like this??Please help answer my questions if you can.    I live in Seattle, Washington.

PREG	Success stories and opinions about scheduled induction	I jsut got back from my doctor's appointment.    I am 33 weeks, 3 days.    My doctor is all about scheduled inductions.    I have mixed feelings.    I have a three year old that is very concerned about me going to the hospital and all of my family is 2 hours away.    So, it would be great to know exactly when my baby is coming and make arrangements for my son.    I was given pitocin with him b/c my water broke, but no contractions began.    It wasn't that bad.    My labor lasted 12 hours, but 3.5 of those were spent pushing.    However, I have heard horror stories about inductions lasting for 20+ hours and I don't want that.    Anyway, I go back to the doctor in 2 weeks and he said we could discuss it further and look at dates.    He said he would be comfortable inducing anytime after 38 weeks which is around August 12.    What are you opinions about induction?

FAML	Is this normal behavior for a 5 year old	My daughter is going to be 6 in November.    She is in her third week of Kindergarten and I can see many changes in her behavior already.    I expected changes, but not this kind.    My daughter has been talking alot about butts, boobies and tookies (Vagina).    She has just started to draw pictures of Tinker Bell with boobs.    She says that her doll has boobs so she is drawing them.    The other day my daughter was playing simon says with her dad and I heard her say simon says touch your tookie.    Totally caught my husband by surprise and I tried to explain to her why that was not approriate to say, but I'm not sure she is hearing me.    She came home from school one day telling me that boys like worms, underwear and butts.    The bus driver informed me that she kissed a boy on the bus.    When I asked her about it, she told me that he kept asking her to kiss him and she kept saying no and then he said please so she kissed him on the chin.    He asked her to kiss him on the lips so when he said please again, she did.My daughter was with my inlaws today and she told them that her baby brother bite her on the tookie.    My son has never bitten, so I'm wondering if she is just a story teller.    My father in law said she was talking a    lot about butts.I need to know is this normal behavior?    I'm starting to worry that she should be seeing a professional.    Should I say something to her teacher?    Will they blame me for her odd behavior?    I am afraid of what could come from her mouth next.Thank you in advance!

DISE	Need Advice on Doses; Levothyroxine to Armour	Yesterday my new doctor started me on Armour. I have been taking generic synthroid after having    a TT in January 2008. The adjustment issues have been a rollercoaster and I was hyper-sensitive to the synthroid as well. Since I am    57, and healthy, my new doc suggested I begin taking (1) 30 mgs per day. My body was used to receiving 112 mgs of Levothyroxine until today. Is 30 mgs of Armour enough or should I take 60mgs.? She really left it up to me and how I was feeling. If I did not feel well, I could call and she would prescribe additional tabs. Any advice here?

Ive only had one partner, with whom I engaged in unprotected vaginal sex with, but we made sure to keep especially clean, not letting fluids or our parts get anything but the opposing organs, and regularly washing right after intercourse.However, while we were together, she cheated with two other guys, both unprotected as well. Both guys had just recently tested negative across the board. No other sex occurred.We have split, and it is now 6 months later.

FAML	grandma thinks this is a problem is she right or is my child ok	"My daughter is going to be two in november. She has developed a habit of wanting to be in her room. She has a tv, vcr, movie, toys, and is allowed to do anything she wants in there without punishment (prettymuch).    She will offten come out to play or see what everyones doing stay out for 40 min or so and go back to her room for about an hour. She also goes to her room if she doesn't get what she wants, or gets in trouble ""told no ect."". we have her on a schedule where she gets up, naps, and goes to bed which she handles fine. However, she really does spend a lot of time in her room. My mom is driving me nuts telling me there's something wrong, and i'm not around all day long so i dont see it (i have school and work full time). is my daughter starting an antisocial habit i should worry about or just getting comfortable with having her on space to be free in?"
DISE	Emergency Room Trips	What happens when you are in sever pain and you call your doctor and he says to go to the emergency room.    The emergency room doc gives you and injection and gives you a small number of a different med for breakthrough pain.    He gave explicit instructions not to take both of the breakthrough meds.

TRMT	dry pasty  white discharge	First off, my question is not about a hysterectomy although it pertains to my question.    I am 36yo and had a abdominal hysterectomy twelve years ago, which included the removal of the upper portion of my vagina, cervix, and uterus.    I still have both my ovaries.    My concern is that I have had dry pasty white vaginal discharge for many years.    I wouldn't call it discharge because it stays stuck to my vaginal walls and does not flow out of me on it's own.    There is no itching, no odor what so ever. I have to use lubrication during sex with my husband because the discharge is so dry.     My doctor cannot find anything wrong.    My paps are normal, no yeast infection, BV infection, and no STDs.     Maybe someone on here can help me figure this out.
GOAL	Is IOL a safe option	I am a 29 year old working female from New Delhi, India. I have myopia since I was 6, and at present it is -6.00 in the left, and -12.00 in the right,with cyindrical powers in both. A few years back I got my eyes examined to be cosidered for a Lasik refractive surgery from the biggest goverment hospital in India (as some of my friends with high myopia were deceived into Lasik surgery and are now in trouble.) Such practices are common in India. That is why I chose to consult doctors in AIIMS, and the doctors there rightfully informed me against Lasik as an option as my cornea lacked the required thickness. A very reputed doctor told me that IOL implants are not a very safe alternative as the long term contraindications are not yet known. I want to get rid of my glasses and want to know a safe alternative. Can I consider IOL? Please guide me through and also if you know of a good eye surgeon in India. Further, does IOL cause any trouble during childbirth? For how long should have I discontinued using soft contact lenses before an IOL implant?This discussion is related toVery high myopia.
GOAL	dent in my scleras	"Hi,I have, for lack of a better explanation, a dent in my scleras. It looks as if one side of the eyes (the sclera side near the nose) is caving in. I had a pressure test done and my pressures were 17 and 16 (dont remember which measurement for each eye it was) so I dont think its hypotony. I have a history of a left frontal lobe fracture which created a fracture from my left orbital rim down the back and to the left of my cheek with possible mucousal thickening in my ethmoid sinuses. This "" indentation"" is occurring in both eyes, accompanied by pain. As time goes on the indentation keeps getting worse and Im afraid this indentation will reach my pupil and distort my vision. My ocuplastic surgeon denied seeing it while my cornea specialist said he could see these deformities. I have sever eye pain, dry eyes, and white mucus (coming from my sinuses?) that forms at the corners of my eyes throughout the day and burns. Antibiotics and steroids haven't worked however the steroids reduced the pain. My question is what specialist should I see, and if this could be some kind of disease at the molecular level. PLEASE ADVISE ME ON WHAT I SHOULD DO!!! Thank you."

PREG	My son of 8 months passed away from SIDS.	Hey. I just joined tonight. My son, Joshua Aiden Day, of 8 months passed away the 2nd of March from SIDS. I don't really talk about it to anyone. I don't cry about it, I just stay angry all the time. I feel like it's my fault. Even though everyone in my family or that knows me tells me it's not my fault, I feel like they are just saying that to make me feel better. I miss him so much. My little monkey was the best little boy ever. He hardly ever cried and he was always smiling and laughing. Aiden changed my life and got taken away from me. Now I feel like I have NOTHING to live for anymore. I feel like I was a bad mom... I don't know what to do anymore. Is anyone else going through this.

FAML	9yr old hearing a voice	My 9yr old has started to hear a mans voice telling her bad things.    Her father has custody of her and her step mother is over disciplining her, by way of spanking with a wooden spoon etc...    This voice is scary to her and they think she is wanting attention and making this up.    The voice tells her not to come to my house and not to be around me.    Also, when she is asked to do chores - it tells her to say no or I don't have to.    She is otherwise a very normal child.    She is very happy and stable at my house and when I talk to her on the phone she seems fine.    Could she be making this up??? I believe her..

FAML	5 yr. old afraid of school experiencing panic attacks?	My 5 yr. old son is so afraid to go to school, he started kindergarten this year. He went the first two days and seemed ok. I did notice strange behaviors like body stiffness and not wanting to talk about his day, upon picking him up from school. Then he started to mention feelings of fear and embarrassment. He said he can't talk at school and his voice changed as he told me this. He mentioned getting hot and shaking. The teacher told me on his third day he cried a lot and he wouldn't participate unless she gave him one on one attention and a lot of reassurance. He claims everything is to hard and the day way to long. He really don't like lunch time either. Every time school is even mentioned he immediately turns red faced his voice gets low and squeaky and he says he's sleepy and goes to lay in his bed, also wants to be alone. He went thru preschool pretty well. The first time he had an anxiety attack was at a new daycare, one that he only went to for about a month and a half. He was ready and excited to start school. He missed a day last week because he was freaking out so bad, I just couldn't force him to go. It breaks my heart to see him so scared. He just began counseling and is scheduled to see a Dr. soon for not being able to sleep and uncontrollable behaviors. The anxiety wasn't there since he hadn't gone to that daycare, school brought it back.

DEMO	Vaginal spotting, period?	I've been taking Sprintec. A generic birth control pill. It causes my period to be regular, depending on if I take the pills like I am supposed to. I am really forgetful, so I forgot to take about a weeks worth of pills. After that I have spotting, light pink, sometimes lined with small strings of blood, constipation, which is causing anxiety because I had unprotected sex with an ex boyfriend about a month to a month in a half ago. Could it be implantation bleeding? Even though it has been a while since having sex and usually implantation bleeding occurs 9-10 days after having sex? Or could it just be my body telling me my period is coming soon? The spotting has been a daily thing for about 3 days now, along with the constipation. I have no nausea, no mood changes, no sore nipples, no sore abdomen or anything.
GOAL	Swollen cheek 2 weeks after 1 wisdom tooth extraction?	"I had my lower right wisdom tooth taken out on approximately 2 weeks ago. The flap is healed, the stitches have fallen out or dissolved, and there is no pain in the area. However, my cheek (on my jawline) is still swollen and puffy (not hard, just puffy), as are the gums around the extraction site and the tooth adjacent to the extraction site. When I brush around the wound, the wound itself does not bleed, but the gums beside it do bleed (minimally) and I'm scared. I had my tooth pulled at a dental school and because the tooth was ""hooked"", it took 2 students and 1 OS resident over 2 hours to get the tooth out. Needless to say, it was a rough surgery. I went back to the dental school for a follow up 5 days after the tooth had come out, and they said it was healing well, they irrigated because it smelled bad, but said there was no need for antibiotics and sent me on my way. They told me that day the swelling should go down within a day or two.Now, it's been 12 days and I'm still having these lingering symptoms. Also, totally unrelated as it was a lower wisdom tooth that was removed, but I did get a sinus infection a few days ago which has seemingly made the wound taste bad and feel sore when I cough or sneeze - is that normal? I have already talked to the student who did the surgery and she said because it was such a rough procedure my symptoms could last longer, but I'm skeptical. Could the site be infected? There is no pain except a general uncomfortable feeling from the swelling.Thank you for your help! :)"

PREG	uncontrollable 3 yr old	I have a soon to be 3 yr old.    The last couple of days, she has been very fresh, talking back, keeps saying that she doesn't want to go anywhere or with anyone.    She has been acting fresh with her grandparents.    I have been wondering if it is due to my 17yr old that moved back in with us in Sept 22, 2007.    My 17 yr old is also uncontrollable and most of the time she's saying and doing things infront of the little one.    I'm also having stress with a custody case for my 17 yr old and my ex husband is not being easy.    I am at my last nerve.    I don't know what to do.    I'm wondering if also my age 43 has something to do with it.    I just don't want to have a disrespecting kid like my 17 yr old.    When I brought up my other 2 children till they were 10 & 11, they were not disrespecting to me.    I only happened when after I left their father.    My 17 yr old came to me with all the problems from 10 yrs old till 17.    So my stress level as you can see is at a very high level and it's going to make me live shorter than normal.    I need help!!! I hope you can help me.
PREG	OPK conflicting results	My husband and I have been trying to conceive for 6 months.    I have very regular cycles and can calculate my expected ovulation date and our most fertile days easily and accurately. Nevertheless, I was using the First Response OPKs for the first 5 months to confirm my calculations of our best days to conceive or baby dance!.    We even started baby dancing every other day as soon as day 10 of my cycle, even with negative OPKs, through day 21 or so.    Discouraged, we started talking to others and we decided to try Clear Blue Digital OPK after hearing others were successful using that brand.    So, this month, I used both simultaneously and was surprised when the two brands did not correspond.    I got a smiley face positive test on the Clear Blue 3 days before the First Response, corresponding with my own calculated prediction.    The First Response test only turned darker/positive 3 days after the Clear Blue and seemed late.    I was wondering if anyone has experienced the same problem or has any advice to offer?

FAML	At wits end with 12yr old son	I am by no mean am a perfect mom. I have made my fair share of mistakes, so please go easy on me. I have 2 sons, Ages 12 and 15 that live with me. Neither have a relationship with thier fathers. I have been with my husband for 7years, married for 1. I have always babied my 12 year old, since he was born my thought was he's my last one, I'd give him anything. When I met my husband he thought I was too easy on my son. He was only 4. (I know now I was) Husband has 3 girls and 2 of them ages 11 and 8 come to visit every other weekend. My husband is very hard on my youngest son, and has no issues with my 15 year old. My youngest son causes massive fights in the family, normaly because he has done something wrong and I feel its my job to stick up and defend him even when he is wrong. I have been a pot smoker for 13 years, (yes before my son was born) never around my kids or in the house. I hid it in the barn apartment for years. Two weeks ago my youngest son snuck out of the house and into the apartment (NO kids allowed in apartment) He stole weed and brought it in the house. Husbands daughter told him about it. I had so much guilt for having it around that it was hard for me to punish him in any way shape or form. My husband was furious, he seen it as my son was jepordizing his kids and his ability to see them. For over a week husband and I fought and my son sat in his room. (everything was taken away from him). Finally it exploded between my husband and I. A huge arguement began, lots of things were said, he called me white trash and I hit him. He called the cops and told them I had hit him. I did not go to jail, I think because my sons were here. I took my kids and left for a few days. We came home and all of us agreeded that we would try to be more patient with eachother and try to get along. Two days later my son was looking for a alen wrench, husband told him do not get into my tools. Twenty minutes later, my son comes in crying, and my husband right behind him yelling. He had gotten into the tools anyway. He was again grounded and punshied (he weeded the garden for 3 days). I thought for sure he had relized that he had done wrong and would not mess up again anytime soon. Two days later my oldest son came to me and told me that my 12yr old took one of my cigarettes and smoked it. I was sooo furious, I asked the 12yr old what he had done and he completley lied. Finally when I got the belt out he told me what he had done. By that time I had lost my temper and spanked him with the belt. (I have never done this before). I feel so guilty for allowing the situation to get to this degree. There is lots more to the story but I am going to try to sum it up. My son will stand there and stare at you when you ask him to do something, like he didnt hear you, but hes just ignoring me. When he does have a chore or something to do, he will take his time, a 15 min chore turns into a 2 hour project. When you ask him something most of the time he whispers in such a low voice you can not hear him. Ask him again and same thing, untill I yell at him. I know he has snuck out of the house and toilet papered the neighbors down the road. His bus driver last year said he will not listen to her, and was kicked off the bus 3 times. His teachers say that he will not do what is asked. So I know its not just at home. It has gotten to the point I just don't know what to do anymore. My husband is so fed up he wants us to move out so that he does not have to deal with it anymore. I don't see that as a option my 15 yr old and I don't want to move. I don't know what to do anymore. I have called a counsler and my son starts next Wednesday. I just don't know if that is going to be enough to save my family, or help my son.    Any advise will be helpful.
TRMT	Large wound on diabetic leg -- the nutritional angle?	"Hello and thank you for reading my post.My father is a end stage renal disease (diagnosed 3 months ago) diabetic.When he was admitted for his renal problem 3 months ago, he caught C. diff.He dealt with it for 2 months and had to go back to the hospital.Because of the renal issues his legs were swollen, which produced a large blister on his right foot.The blister got infected and he had pretty severe necrosis of the shin area which underwent debridement . The wound is currently filled with the sponge/VAC machine which drains fluid (of reddish color). He has been with the VAC for about 6 days.I just spoke to one of the doctors and says his protein count is low, so they are hooking him up to a nutritional IV. He also gets these amino acid sachets which his meals. When I asked the doctor if I could bring anything foodwise she said that ""the nutritionist is calculating how much protein he needs"". After seeing the food they give to people in hospitals and I can't say i trust much the hospital nutritionist, hence I am doing my own research.The doctor said that it the wound does not heal sooner rather than later they will consider amputation in order to avoid further complication from being in bed so long (ulcers and so on).Therefore, getting him the best nutrition possible to help his wound heal fast is very important.Another thing: they want him to drink this Ensure and Boost drinks that have ""sugar"" as the 3rd ingredient (his sugar was in the 300s this afternoon). They say that he needs this for his immune system and for his leg to recover. Is there better alternate supplements to get?Anyone have any ideas about nutrition?ideas about preventing ulcers/damage from being in bed for too long?Thank you."

FAML	Potty Training	My daughter is three years old and is completely potty trained when it comes to urinating.    But, for some reason she only wants to poop in a diaper.    She will hold it and say the poop is coming and cries for a diaper.    If I refuse to put a diaper on her and insist that she sit on the potty, she screams and cries until she poops.    After she poops she is ok, not great, but is ok.    She has on occasion clapped her hands, flushed the toilet and been very proud about her accomplishment and tells me that she will poop in the potty next time.    That it was fun. Other times, it's just ok and insist that I flush the toilet immediatley.    But, by the time she has to go again, it's the same thing all over.    Screaming, crying hysterically, asking for a diaper, until she poops and she is happy she did it. Any ideas about this behavior and if I'm doing the right thing by refusing her the diaper to poop in?

FAML	3 year old grandson is a nightmare at daycare	"I've been told a couple of times from very tired looking caregivers, that my grandson is basically out of control, much of the time. He doesn't listen, has been mean to the other children, and is always always busy.    I myself have often wondered if he isn't ADHD; he is always busy, and can't seem to spend any length of time with one activity.....just goes from one thing to another. And one on one with me, is good, most of the time, but he demands a lot of my attention. He is very sweet, and loves to cuddle, is kind toward the cats and dogs, and even the ""monster"" he invented. I do know there is a lot of stress in his life......he adores his daddy, but daddy had to move out and mom then moved in her new boyfriend (to who she married). He will tell me ""I miss my daddy"", and lives to see him again.How much of this is normal behavior? How to deal with it? I love the little guy with my whole heart and soul, and try to take him every other weekend, so that he has some sense of stability.

TRMT	Carnitine and bad reaction	Hi, I have been given 4 supplements by my integrative pain med doctor for energy and muscle pain. I was asked to take up to 1000mg of coenzyme Q10, 100mg twice a day of a B1,B6, and Malate, twice a day corvalin (d-ribose) and 1000mg twice a day of carnitine. I was able to get up to 800 mg of Coenzyme Q10, the twice daily dose of d-ribose, and 200mg of the B1,B6, malate combo. I was on each of these for about at least 4 days and then I got the carnitine in and took 500mg in the morning. I felt really tired all day, and felt short of breath.I just though perhaps I was overtired that day so I took the second pill of 500mg of carnitine in the evening and at bedtime I felt more short of breath and I then felt my pulse and it was beating two time then skip a beat, then two times then skip a beat and so on. I got worried and told my husband . We decided to wait a bit and about a hour or two later my heart beat started to go back to normal. I have had a 12 lead EKG recently and it was normal (before the supplements) and he said my heart sounded very strong. So, I went down by half on everything and stopped the carnitine. My doctor agreed. But I was wondering if any of you have had a bad reaction like this? Carnitine is supposed to be good for the heart as is Coenzyme Q10. So, I don't know why but my body sure didn't like it. Any other comments. I am now on 100mg of the b6 as I worried about getting neuropathy at a higher dose and it does help my muscle pain a bit, along with the magnesium I already take.thanks in advance,mkh9
TRMT	Help!	I am 32 and had a total hysteremctomy 1.5 yrs. ago.    I was put on hormones and I took them for a while, but it did not help with the hot flashes.    I saw another Dr. who has a totally different way of approaching hot flashes.    She put me on a estrogen spray (evamist) which I spray on the inside of my left arm 2 sprays every night and the she put me on Androgel ( testosterone ).    Its a gel and I use 1 pump every other night and apply it to the inside of my right arm.    I am scared to take these drugs and have stopped taking them like I am suppose to.    My aunt recentely got diagnosed with breast cancer and it seems like there are a lot of people around me getting cancer or someone knows someone who has it or has had it due to taking these hormones after a hysterectomy.    I would like to go a natural route, but don't know who to turn to.    I can not deal with these hot flashes.    During one it feels like my blood boils inside and the sweat just pours down.    I can't sleep at night without a fan blowing on me, and am constantely up and down at night.    Please does anyone know what to do?    I know I can't take hormones for a long time, but what are women suppose to do in the mean time with the symptoms until they reach menopause on their own?    Does anyone know if vitamins actually work for preventing osteoporosis?    Vitamin D and calcium.Thank youshuffle

FAML	Is this normal behaviour ?	My little brother tries on my bra's and knickers at any times possible he'll sneak off, strip naked and try them on. he has only just turned 3 a couple of weeks ago, this has been going on for about a year. Its not just my underwear its any bra's or knickers that he can find. my mum and my dad tell him off for this, i just egnore it but take back my underwear. I am not sure if this is possible but I think it may be sexual as he has an erection whilst he does this? apart from this his behaviour is quite normal and boyish.

TRMT	hormone therapy	I am 56 yrs old and had a total hysterctomy today.    I have been through menapause, but never took anything.    Just put up with the hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia etc.    My skin is not so dry, but I am very dry vaginally and after many years of enjoying sex, I no longer desire it at all.    Haven't for about 4 yrs. which doesn't make for a very happy 43 yr old boyfriend I have been living wih for 7 yrs.    He is very tolerant and I do what I can.I have never thought about hormone replacement and have no knowledge about it at all.    My doctor is going to talk to me about it next week when I go for my post op appt.I have read several of the posts on this site, but it seems that all of the ones I read were much younger than I, and had not gone through menapause 1st.I had started bleeding again, was told by one doctor it was benign fibroids that needed to be removed.    when I went to another doctor recommended by a friend, whom I had accompanied her to the doctor on a couple of occassions and really took a liking to her.    She examined me and found a polyp at the mouth of my cervix, turned out to be pre cancerous.    Also the lining of my uturus was much thicker than it should be for my age.I opted for the ovaries to be removed also, since ovarian cancer is one of the worse and because of my age.I would like some info before I see her again, info about someone who had already gone through menapause.    I have heard you can go through it again.    Don't know if that is true or not.Any help and info will be greatly appreciated,    Debi

DISE	What's causing this?	My throats been bothering me for about a week now. I went to my pediatric doctor(though I'm 17) and she perscriped Azithromycin; I think that's the name. I've taken 4 pills of the 5 she gave me, and haven't skipped any doses or anything, but my throat doesn't look much better. It's swollen with white looking places on them, which I suppose is infection. I just thought it should be cleared up by now, and there's still a little pain sometimes. But the pain is not near as bad as it was before. What's freaking me out is that my left tonsil looks like it's shriveling up, literally. It's weird.... and my right tonsil is really swollen. Any clue as to what I might have?Thank you.

DEMO	***Update***	"Hey guys, ok so yesterday I went to the emergency room. I was so light headed and vomitting, still bleeding and cramping. [for those who do not know my situation, please read threads ""A little scared"" and ""*Update* A little scared"". Wednesday night was bad for me, after my boyfriend took me home thats when I started bleeding heavier and passing large clots.So I went to the hospital yesterday morning at 8:30am [lol i was in the kid area cuz Im under 21 haha] the doctors there did another pelvic exam and another pap [the pap i have to wait 3-5 days for results, but if I dont receive a call then it was ok], they did blood tests and 2 more sonograms [regular and internal].And they did not find anything!! I dont have fibriods, i dont have any tumors or cysts or anything. I know as horrible as it sounds, but I was kinda hoping for atleast 1 cyst so atleast I knew what was causing the bleeding. They think as a possibilty my hormones are slightly out of balance. So after 5 hours in the hospital, I didnt get any answers.So I went to my doctor right after the hospital, he doesnt seem to concerned about it, he says yes it might be my hormones or it could just be a wacky cycle im having. So he is sending me for another blood test to check my hormones and a few other things, which I will do that tommorow morning. And I guess I will go from there.I am still bleeding rather light no clots, my cramps are on and off but then again I am extremly sore down there and it hurts to walk but yet Im sitting here typing this at work...lolAnyways ladies, I will keep you all updated when I get my results of my blood work. : )~Niki~"

FAML	Will it ever end?!	My beautiful 11 year old daughter has chronic excema. She is hospitalised once a year for IV antibiotics and wound management. On average she is on antibiotics once a month. She has frequent out breaks of boils on her legs and bottocks so bad that walking is too painful and is unable to attend school as she can not sit for too long. Her feet swell up like footballs and crack. She has developed migraine headaches and chronic nose bleeds as well. This girl of mine is wonderful and is truly gorgeous; it breaks my heart every time I have to deal with any one of these things as they are all painful for her. I have tried baths, dressings, special washes, natural lotions, blood purifing elixes, supplements and conventional medicines! To top it off my husband gets excema too and has had a boil for the first time a few months a go and I have had two in the last 3 months also for the first time....... WHAT IS GOING ON?! I'm not a clean freak but I do like to keep a clean and tidy home and my daughter has her own hand towels and linens which are changed regularly. Doctors give me more pills and potions and instructions (oh the beep beep instructions!). I fell rather tired and very frustrated!

DISE	just a wee thought...	My maternal grandfather has always had problems sleeping, and my mother has inherited this to some degree, not helped by the fact that she works shifts. I first noticed I had trouble sleeping at age 11, roughly 6 years ago. I know it runs in the family, but mine is so much more severe than my mum and grandpa's. It has gotten to the stage now where I go several days without any sleep and then a couple of days where I sleep, but it is broken and filled with nightmares. My mental health is not great, but not as bad as it has previously been (where the only sleep I could ever get was drug-induced).I have just finished high school, where the problem was bad but manageable. I am due to start a job on Thursday and it includes administering medications (to dogs and cats, but that's not the point), and I can't afford to be overtired and running on adrenaline.Any suggestions or general feedback would be much appreciated.Thanks

DEMO	Period	Hi everyone,My period just started today, and I've decided to go on the pill with the approval of my doctor, so I took my first pill today. I'm on Alesse 28 days... This is my first time ever being on the pill.I have a very important weekend coming up at the end of this month (August 31 - September 4) and without being on the pill, my period would have fallen right on those days. I really need to not have a period on that weekend - Or at least increase my chances of not having it then. I have trouble gauging the probabilities of any actions I could take, so can anyone help me? Even during the first month of taking your pill, does the withdrawal bleeding really come within 3 days after beginning to take the placebo pills?Would I be more successful in not having my period over that weekend by: A) Skipping the placebo pills and thereby trying to skip the withdrawal bleeding and pray for no breakthrough bleeding OR B) Taking the pills as directed, including the placebos, and pray that the withdrawal bleeding ends before the 31st? Please speak from experience!Thank you for your time!
FAML	PLEASE HELP!!	"My 3 year old son is completely out of control. His father and I have been divorced for 2 years. His father has not seen him in over a month and the last time they saw each other, he was the witness to physcial abuse(from his father) to me.We have recently moved in with his grandparents..where of course he gets away with more. His behavior has seen to drasticaly change within the last few months. He attends daycare where they say that he is the ""typical 3 year old little boy"". Nothing major! When he stays with his grandparents alone, they will tell me he was angel. WIth me.. he does not listen, he hits me, he kicks and hits anything around, has a temper tantrum, and slaps and hits hisself in the face, pinches his self, pulls his hair. He yells at me slams doors, and throw things. I do dicipline him..I know I do let him get away with something he shouldnt but it doesnt seem that spanking with my hand or belt is helping and I have even tried just talking to him without spanking him. He knows when he does something wrong!    I know as being a single mother of a child who doesnt have a active father I feel a bit guilty when I continuously have to spank him or yell at him. I want him to grow up with good morals and values.Which basically is the complete opposite of his father. I want him to respect me and others and have the manners that he should. What do I do. I am open to any suggestions!!"

My have developed severe osteoporosis due to the abnormal functioning of the parathyroid, I also experienced severe aches and movement issues specially in my joints, hip bone etc. Post surgery i found some temporary relief but two months down the aches and pains have resurfaced.

DEMO	Fibromyalgia + Chronic Fatigue & Still Serving	"To anyone who might have insight,I entered the military a 19, and have served six years in the Air National Guard, and the past two in the Army National Guard until present. I will be hitting my 8 years of service this December 2010. I have about accumulated about 3 years of active service for training and various active duty tours. No overseas tours, I volunteered, but never deployed to combat, though I did spent a year in Kuwait as an Army civilian. I am 26 now, and a E-5/Sgt. in the Army National Guard. Full-time, I am civilian service in the Army community. My MOS is Public Affairs, and I am attached to an MPAD (Mobile Public Affairs Detachment) National Guard unit. In one capacity or another, in uniform or out, I have served this country since 2003.I remember having pain throughout most of my adult life, and thinking it was normal. I went through bootcamp and AIT with it. After the pain escalted during my time in Kuwait, I began seeking professional care through my civilian healthcare, and returned to the states after my commitment at the end of the year. I went through about two years of testing and worsing symptoms to include pain and insomnia. It got so bad to the point of depression, problems with work and family, and just be able to fully function. I was finally diagnosed this past September with Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome. After finding a great Dr. and working on a multi-facated treatment plan, I am not cured but functioning better than I have in two years.Because my diagnosis is recent, my name has not come up for deployment, and I have been able to muster through drill periods for the last two years, I have not yet disclosed this information to the Army National Guard. I am concerned that if I do, I will be    discharged and lose my current education benefits. I am also concerned because I have served 8 years of service, and am I not finished. I have a spotless service record, and only one line-of-duty injury that I have been able to recover from for the most part. I want to deploy still, and finish serving my time. I do not know how the Army or Veterans Affairs will treat me because of the Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue and serving mostly as a National Guard member or Army civilian, and not on regluar active duty. At this point, I am taking regular medications and being treated for pain management weekly, still passing PT diagnostics unless I'm am in the middle of a flair-up, and continuing to perform to the best of my abilities. There is no known cause, or cure for this, and only my former LT, who is no longer a guard member, is aware of the condition. I am being treated with several medications that help with pain and insomnia, physical and massage therapy, and doing regular yoga and exercise.Though I am doing well now, I do not know how my condition would react should I have to deploy or attend training courses I will coming up for, such as WLC, ect. I had also hoped to apply to a combat camera unit (airborne) with a high deployment tempo, a goal I have now put on hold until I can figure out a game plan.    Though I want to deploy, I understand the risk I could put others in if I am not healthy in combat zone.I am not looking for an ""Out"" from the military, nor am I looking for guidance on how to get the military to give me a disability rating. I'm looking for guidance on how I might be treated when, or if I even should, disclose this information to the military, and hoping to find anyone with experience with this, or a doctor in the military community that might now what would come next. Thank you."

TRMT	desiring information about taking a ferritin suppliment	I have a low ferritin level and my doctor put me on ferritin.    I called the compounding pharmacist in town to find out if it is availible to buy there and they said they have never heard of it.    I called my dr. back and they said that they are the only ones that have it available and I have to buy it in their dr. office (an integrative women's health office).    I am wondering what the difference is between ferritin and ferrous glycinate.    I am also wondering if the side effects of the ferritin are similiar to the other iron suppliments that are out there.    I am also wondering if ferritin is better absorbed with vitamin c and if taking ferritin with calcium can prevent optimum absorbtion.
GOAL	recetly one pupil is bigger than the other, mainly at night	Recently ive noticed one of my pupils is larger than the other. this usually occurs late at night and when im tired. When it is at its largest incomparison to the other i feel really dizzy and feel like im about to fall over. During the day my pupils seem to be really small but of similar size.Ive also recently been having pains in my chest and panic attacks. I had a resting ecg and this was okay, just waiting back on the 24hr ecg results. But i feel its more in my head than my chest as ive been having really bad headaches, and pressure accross the bridge of my nose. I took a trip to the opticians and they told me my eyesight is fine and that i do not need glasses.I am now really worried, as i feel dizzy everyday, and periods where im walking for quite a while i feel as though im about to fall over to the righthand side and feel extremely dizzy. sometimes it feels like its a struggle to walk and i have to force my body to keep moving. the same thing occasionally occurs with my speech, i can still speak but i have a feeling as if my body is forcing me not to speak.Along with these symptoms, my eyes have been of a really dark yellow which i think has something to do with gilberts syndrome that i have but it seems worse than usual, i have little energy, my skin is bruising more easily, especially on my legs, i have ringing in my ears, occasionally have blurred vision, especially if i eat and walk at the same time my vision moves up and down, theres also like a clicking/sucking noise behind my right eye, this only happens again late at night when im tired etc.Any ideas on what these things could be? i have been feeling unwell now for 8 weeks, and havnt really got anywhere with the appointments at the doctors. its starting to really worry me.

GOAL	Bubble on eye white	I do not wear eyeliner nor do I wear contact lens but my eyes are watery and constantly run.    I do wear glasses and I am on the computer daily for most of the day for my job.     According to an eye doctor I saw in December I was told that I have dry eyes and to use an eye drop twice a day.    This would reduce the watery eyes and the constantly eye running.    I have been using the drops faithfully and my eyes don't run as much but I notice when I miss using the drops for a few days they will begin to run.    A few weeks ago I noticed something in my eye that appeared to look like a circle.    A few days ago I noticed the circle had turned into a bubble.    I am not certain what this means but it appears to be some type of infection that needs to be looked at by an eye doctor.    What are your suggestions?     I am most concern about my health.    I would greatly appreciate a response to my question as soon as possible.

FAML	Please help with my almost 4 year old	Could someone please tell me what i need to do i have a little girl that will be 4 in December.    She has a behavioral problem.    She has been like this since she was able to walk and talk.    For examples: when she was little she would pull the kitchen chair up to the table and get whatever she wanted out of the cabinet no matter how high up it is she would figure out how to do it then we hit the terrible 2 stage and that is what we thought it was so we just diplined her having timeouts and all .    But it gets worse i cant take her in public nowhere she shows her butt to i dont want to be seen with her .    I follow thur with the punishment that i tell her she is going to get.    And it does not get any better.    A couple more examples of things she does is that she has spray painted my truck i take her to other places and she some how finds things that she knows that she is not suppose to have and gets them and hides it ans runs with it.    She has took permanent marker and marked all over the walls.    She took a pair of scissors the other day when i told her to go for a nap and i went and tucked her in and she cut my spread bc she didnt want to take a nap and today she ripped up a box that i was suppose to have shipped out today and the people could not take it bc she ripped up the sticker. And when you ask her if she has done it she lies and lies and lies when you know she did it.    What can i do i have put her in time out i have took things away from her i have spanked her i have not let her go anywhere i have done it all and i just dont know what else to do seems like when i punish her it gets worse and worse instead of better
TRMT	scar revision surgery....	".... a little background history...... when I was 2yrs. old, a city dumpster fell on my, causing me to bleed internally,    having to have surgery. It left a scar, and as I grew, so did the scar -- it is now 10"" by 1.5"" across my abdomen, right below where my rib cage ends and seriously looks like a set of railroad tracks. My tummy looks like it is smiling. I have insant 'muffin top' because of this scar. Apparently the scar has adhered to muscles, tissue, and lord knows what else.I am scheduled for surgery October 21st. The surgeon is going to cut out the entire scar, make sure that all the adhesions are 'gone' and then proceed to give me a new 'less visible' scar.Anyone else have this kind of surgery?"

DEMO	Implantation Cramps????	I'm not sure if I'm having implantation cramps or not. My period was supposed to be here on the 9th....it is MIA. It's not so much cramping as it feels like pressure, not so much gas. Like something is pressing down on my lower abdomen, as if I'm wearing low cut tight pants. Does this sound like it could be it? I've had this feeling ever since last week, on and off... sometimes more intense than others, and I also feel like I have light cramping feeling...kind of like when I am about to get my period, but much lighter.......I took a hpt last week, but it came up negative.... I'm wondering now if I tested too early. Anyone know if this can be it??

FAML	My 5 yr old little boy is urinating in inappropriate places	My 5 yr old is also urinating in inappropriate places.    I've read several other cases here on this forum with the same issue.    The only commonality that jumps out at me between these children seems to be that they're all, or at least the majority are, underdeveloped somehow.    My son was 2 months early.    He is developmentally about 6 months behind his peers.    Could this be some Fruedian desire to remain a baby?    I'm at my wits in.    Last week he decided urinating on the hall stairs would be fun.    He soaked the first three stairs.    This morning he promptly got up, and went into his toy room and peed on another one of his carpet squares.    (Thank goodness they are carpet squares!)    He pees outside when I'm not looking and the worst was last week when he peed in the middle of my bed!    Tips please!    This is unacceptable!    Now when guests come over, I'm afraid that I haven't got all the smell out and the house smells like a cat box.    Ah yes, the cat box; another of his favorite places to pee!    He also defecates there and does that outside also.This discussion is related toBehavior problem of Urinating on Toys and Carpet.

SOCL	worried	"Hi, I do not know if I am posting in the correct place, and if I am not, for that I am sorry. My wife has been experiancing a few different symptoms and they are only getting worse. I am in the Army and she has been to doctors, but they never can seem to find out why. They only give her pills to cover all the symptoms. She cannot hold food down. On the occasion that she does, she ends up with the runs. She has been getting really bad headaches and they have been more and more frequent and painful. When she eats, regardless if she holds it down or not, she becomes really bloated. We thought for a while that the bloating might be from salt for some reason, because she went to the beach and became extremely bloated, but we are not sure why. She has complained of tightness of the chest, pain in her arm, and at random times either her arms, hands, feet, and legs would ""fall asleep"". The other night she woke up with a lot of pain in her chest and said it was difficult to breathe. It only lasted for about 10 minutes. She has spoken to internal medicine, has had blood work, x-rays, EKG, and an MRI. They do not yet know what is going on and I was hopeing that I might find someone who has come across these symptoms before and might have an idea of what it could be.If anyone knows, please help. I am very worried about my wife and I am deployed so I cannot even be there with her as she is going through all this.Thank you for your time."
SOCL	Doc deficit? Nurses&#x27; role may grow in 28 states	"CHICAGO - A nurse may soon be your doctor.With a looming shortage of primary care doctors, 28 states are considering expanding the authority of nurse practitioners. These nurses with advanced degrees want the right to practice without a doctor's watchful eye and to prescribe narcotics. And if they hold a doctorate, they want to be called ""Doctor.""For years, nurse practitioners have been playing a bigger role in the nation's health care, especially in regions with few doctors. With 32 million more Americans gaining health insurance within a few years, the health care overhaul is putting more money into nurse-managed clinics.Those newly insured patients will be looking for doctors and may find nurses instead.The medical establishment is fighting to protect turf. In some statehouses, doctors have shown up in white coats to testify against nurse practitioner bills. The American Medical Association, which supported the national health care overhaul, says a doctor shortage is no reason to put nurses in charge and endanger patients.Nurse practitioners argue there's no danger. They say they're highly trained and as skilled as doctors at diagnosing illness during office visits. They know when to refer the sickest patients to doctor specialists. Plus, they spend more time with patients and charge less.""We're constantly having to prove ourselves,"" said Chicago nurse practitioner Amanda Cockrell, 32, who tells patients she's just like a doctor ""except for the pay.""On top of four years in nursing school, Cockrell spent another three years in a nurse practitioner program, much of it working with patients. Doctors generally spend four years in undergraduate school four years in medical school and an additional three in primary care residency training.Medicare, which sets the pace for payments by private insurance, pays nurse practitioners 85 percent of what it pays doctors. An office visit for a Medicare patient in Chicago, for example, pays a doctor about $70 and a nurse practitioner about $60.The health care overhaul law gave nurse midwives, a type of advanced practice nurse, a Medicare raise to 100 percent of what obstetrician-gynecologists make Ã¢ € ” and that may be just the beginning.States regulate nurse practitioners and laws vary on what they are permitted to do:In Florida and Alabama, for instance, nurse practitioners are barred from prescribing controlled substances.In Washington, nurse practitioners can recommend medical marijuana to their patients when a new law takes effect in June.In Montana, nurse practitioners don't need a doctor involved with their practice in any way.Many other states put doctors in charge of nurse practitioners or require collaborative agreements signed by a doctor.In some states, nurse practitioners with a doctorate in nursing practice can't use the title ""Dr."" Most states allow it.The AMA argues the title ""Dr."" creates confusion. Nurse practitioners say patients aren't confused by veterinarians calling themselves ""Dr."" Or chiropractors. Or dentists. So why, they ask, would patients be confused by a nurse using the title?By 2015, most new nurse practitioners will hold doctorates, or a DNP, in nursing practice, according to a goal set by nursing educators. By then, the doctorate will be the standard for all graduating nurse practitioners, said Polly Bednash, executive director of the American Association of Colleges of Nursing.Many with the title use it with pride.""I don't think patients are ever confused. People are not stupid,"" said Linda Roemer, a nurse practitioner in Sedona, Ariz., who uses ""Dr. Roemer"" as part of her e-mail address.Quality of care same as docs, study finds What's the evidence on the quality of care given by nurse practitioners?The best U.S. study comparing nurse practitioners and doctors randomly assigned more than 1,300 patients to either a nurse practitioner or a doctor. After six months, overall health, diabetes tests, asthma tests and use of medical services like specialists were essentially the same in the two groups.""The argument that patients' health is put in jeopardy by nurse practitioners? There's no evidence to support that,"" said Jack Needleman, a health policy expert at the University of California Los Angeles School of Public Health.Other studies have shown that nurse practitioners are better at listening to patients, Needleman said. And they make good decisions about when to refer patients to doctors for more specialized care.The nonpartisan Macy Foundation, a New York-based charity that focuses on the education of health professionals, recently called for nurse practitioners to be among the leaders of primary care teams. The foundation also urged the removal of state and federal barriers preventing nurse practitioners from providing primary care.AMA fighting proposals to expand careThe American Medical Association is fighting proposals in about 28 states that are considering steps to expand what nurse practitioners can do.For rest of article see the following:http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/36472308/ns/health-health_care/"
PREG	Natural ways to help my 2 year old son with add	"Hello.    My son is 2 1/2 years old and is extremely hyperactive.    From the moment he wakes up in the morning until he goes to bed at night he is ""on the go"" as my husband and I call it.    He has pretty much been like this since he was able to walk.    He doesn't listen when being told to do things, he dosesn't respond to time out or any sort of discipline.    I thought that it was just a 2 year old thing or even a boy thing, but now it seems to be interfering in other things.    I am a stay-at-home-mom so I am always with him.    We have what I call an ""arts and crafts"" time every morning after breakfast... during this time we color, draw pictures, make signs for daddy, ect.    During this time he throws the crayons across the room, ripes the paper up, ect.    I can not get him to concentrate at all.    Then during the afternoons if its nice outside we will go to the park or take a walk.    This is another ordel.    He doesn't socialize well with the other children, he is yelling and trying to push them over.    I feel like I am constantly apoligizing to the other mothers for his behavior.    On days when it isn't nice outside, I put in a movie for him and he can't even sit still for 5 mins during it.    He is up and down off of the couch, picking up his toys and throwing them around the room, running up and down the stairs.    I put him it time out when things get really out of control for 2 1/2 mins, then explain to him what he did and that that type of behavior is unexceptable and he will go right back to doing it.    He goes back into time out again and again and again with the same results everytime.    Now within the last week he is refusing to eat.    He will eat a little bit and then starting throwing the food off of his plate, turning his cup over to spill his milk on the floor, hitting whoever is sitting next to him.    I have repeatedly took him out of his chair and into time out and again nothing works.    I am at my wits end.    His doctor says that he is definintely showing signs of adhd and probably needs to be on medication.    I DO NOT want him on medication!! I am scared and tired and not sure what to do.    Is there a natural way to make this better??    I tried adjusting his diet.    He only drinks milk and water.     I make him healthy foods for all of this meals - not that he really eats them anymore.    He doesn't eat sugary snacks.    Any advice would be soooo helpful."

SOCL	China poised to play 'debt card ...for US Land ...	This was sent to me from tea party..com     trust me they are back, the gun control issue    has brought them out of their holes'     China poised to play debt card Ã¢ € “ for U.S. landCommunist nation could control American land as Ã¢ € ˜development zonesÃ¢ € ™(Dr. Jerome R. Corsi) Ã¢ € “ Could real estate on American soil owned by China be set up as Ã¢ € œdevelopment zonesÃ¢ €  in which the communist nation could establish Chinese-owned businesses and bring in its citizens to the U.S. to work?ThatÃ¢ € ™s part of an evolving proposal Beijing has been developing quietly since 2009 to convert more than $1 trillion of U.S debt it owns into equity.SPECIAL: Bypass the Lame Stream Media! Expose The Truth About Ã¢ € ˜AmericaÃ¢ € ™s Fraud PresidentÃ¢ € ™ to UNLIMITED Households!Under the plan, China would own U.S. businesses, U.S. infrastructure and U.S. high-value land, all with a U.S. government guarantee against loss.Yu Qiao, a professor of economics in the School of Public Policy and Management at Tsighua University in Beijing, proposed in 2009 a plan for the U.S. government to guarantee foreign investments in the United States.WND has reliable information that the Bank of China, ChinaÃ¢ € ™s central bank, has continued to advance the plan to convert ChinaÃ¢ € ™s holdings of U.S. debt into equity owned by China in the U.S.The Obama administration, under the plan, would grant a financial guarantee as an inducement for China to convert U.S. debt into Chinese direct equity investment. China would take ownership of successful U.S. corporations, potentially profitable infrastructure projects and high-value U.S. real estate.The plan would be designed to induce China to resume lending to the U.S. on a nearly zero-interest basis.However, converting Chinese debt to equity investments in the United States could easily add another $1 trillion to outstanding Obama administration guarantees issued in the current economic crisis.As of November 2012, China owned $1.17 trillion in U.S. Treasury securities, according to U.S. Department of Treasury and Federal Reserve Board calculations published Jan. 16.Concerned about the unrestrained growth in U.S. debt under the Obama administration, China has reduced by 97 percent its holdings in short-term U.S. Treasury bills. ChinaÃ¢ € ™s holding of $573.7 billion in August 2008, prior to the massive bank bailouts and stimulus programs triggered by the collapse in the U.S. mortgage market, dwindled to $5.96 billion by March 2011.Treasury bills are short-term debt that matures in one year or less, sold to finance U.S. debt. Holdings of Treasury bills are included in the $1.17 trillion of total Treasury securities owned by China as of November 2012.In addition to a national debt in excess of $16 trillion, the U.S. government in 2010 faced over $70 trillion in unfunded obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits scheduled to be paid retiring baby boomer retirees in the coming decades, with unfunded obligations showing no sign of being reduced with Congress at a deadlock over reducing federal government spending.Yu Qiao observed that if the U.S. dollar collapsed under the weight of proposed Obama administration trillion-dollar budget deficits into the foreseeable future, holders of U.S. debt would face substantial losses that the Financial Times estimated Ã¢ € œwould devastate AsiansÃ¢ € ™ hard-earned wealth and terminate economic globalization.Ã¢ € Ã¢ € œThe basic idea is to turn Asian savings, ChinaÃ¢ € ™s in particular, into real business interests rather than let them be used to support U.S. over-consumption,Ã¢ €  Yu Qiao wrote, reflecting themes commonly suggested by Chinese government officials. Ã¢ € œWhile fixed-income securities are vulnerable to any fall in the value of the dollar, equity claims on sound corporations and infrastructure projects are at less risk from a currency default,Ã¢ €  he continued.The problem is that, in a struggling U.S. economy, China does not want to trade its investment in U.S. Treasury debt securities, with their inherent risk of dollar devaluation, for equally risky investments in U.S. corporations and infrastructure projects.Ã¢ € œBut Asians do not want to bear the risk of this investment because of market turbulence and a lack of knowledge of cultural, legal and regulatory issues in U.S. businesses,Ã¢ €  he stressed. Ã¢ € œHowever if a guarantee scheme were created, Asian savers could be willing to invest directly in capital-hungry U.S. industries.Ã¢ € Yu QiaoÃ¢ € ™s plan included four components:China would negotiate with the U.S. government to create a Ã¢ € œcrisis relief facility,Ã¢ €  or CRF. The CRF Ã¢ € œwould be used alongside U.S. federal efforts to stabilize the banking system and to invest in capital-intensive infrastructure projects such as high-speed railroad from Boston to Washington, D.C.China would pool a portion of its holdings of Treasury bonds under the CFR umbrella to convert sovereign debt into equity. Any CFR funds that were designated for investment in U.S. corporations would still be owned and managed by U.S. equity holders, with the Asians holding minority equity shares Ã¢ € œthat would, like preferred stock, be convertible.Ã¢ € The U.S. government would act as a guarantor, Ã¢ € œproviding a sovereign guarantee scheme to assure the investment principal of the CRF against possible default of targeted companies or projectsÃ¢ € .The Federal Reserve would set up a special account to supply the liquidity the CRF would require to swap sovereign debt into industrial investment in the United States.Ã¢ € œThe CRF would lessen AsiansÃ¢ € ™ concern about implicit default of sovereign debts caused by a collapsing dollar,Ã¢ €  Yu Qiao concluded. Ã¢ € œIt would cost little and help the U.S. by channeling funds to business investment.Ã¢ € ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~1776Nation.comJerome R.

FAML	Sleepwalk Sexonmia	"I have a question about myself, just last night I had a wierd dream of having unprotected sex with my girl friend. Now I looked up on the net about sleepwalking, and I found    You carry out sex acts during your sleep, fully unaware that you are doing so. The behavior may be limited to your own bedroom, or you might actually leave your home, sleepwalk to your girlfriendÃ¢ € ™s house and have a night of wild sex that you wonÃ¢ € ™t remember in the morning."" I know my girl friend's house is very far. I'm not sure if sleepwalkers can open the door or even unlock the door but I have found my door's lock to be unlocked. When I was in my dream it actually felt real, like it was real sex. When I woke up from the nightmare I was found in my bed. Is this a major problem? Should I get tested for STDs/HIV afterwards?"

FAML	My child needs help, I don't know where else to go. Does anyone have any sug...	For the last 2 and half to 3 years my daughter, who is now 9 has had issues with having accidents. She has several accidents a day with BM. It started around the time I got pregnant with my youngest, so we just assumed it was due to trying to deal with that, but it just kept continuing. Now years later, we have tried everything. We have taken her to a family doctor who ran a few tests (for parasites, blood in her BM, etc.) When nothing came of that he recommended a pediatric gasternologist (he is suppose to be the best here in Tucson). We went to see him, followed his order to a t and tried to help her as much as possible. Last month he said that he doesn't need to see her because she is doing much better. Which is not the case at all, and I let him know how I felt. I have yet to see any improvement. We done everything he has said, enemas, laxitives, stool softners, fiber, diet. I have to admit, my husband does get frustrated at times, my husband tells her a lot to stop being so lazy. I dont know if thats really the case at all or if she truly cant feel the urge. I was confiding to a close friend about this and she said it sounds like she could have something called Encopresis. I have researched it a little and feel that is a good possiblity. I asked our family doctor about it, and he refered me to the same doctor. It's just a continous circle with no hope in sight. I dont know what else to do. Sometimes I feel so sorry for my daughter because this can't be easy for her. She has accidents at school, and she smells bad. We send extra clothes and have talked to her principal and teacher. My fear is that it will never end and what kind of life will my daughter have. Please if you know where I can get help for my daughter, let me know.

TRMT	Time to quit!	"Okay...so I've tried so many things in the past to relieve anxiety, and none have helped much...gave up coffee, but then started back up again...which was stupid because it really WAS helping.As most of you know, I have a doctor induced phobia of taking pills...even the thought of taking herbal supplements scares the daylights out of me because of all the BAD experiences I've had in the past with medications. Even taking vitamins scares me...silly I know, but...true.Anyway...thought it's about time to quit smoking as well. I've read the literature...I know how bad smoking is...I know it CAUSES anxiety and does not relieve it in any way, shape, or form.Now is a very good time to quit because I have the urge to do so. I have been having very bad chest pains for the past week now...not sure if they are anxiety induced or not, but I don't care...I need to stop smoking, and need to do it now!I am reading Allen Carr's Easy Way To Stop Smoking ( which someone on here suggested about a year or so ago)...other methods have failed me miserably.Allergic to the tape on the patches, can't chew gum, keep swallowing the lozenges, etc.Allen says in his book that there should be no added anxiety when trying his method...but for those who have a preexisting anxiety condition? I'm not so sure.Anyway, I've heard that certain smells can alleviate anxiety. I know this to be true to a degree, because the smell of Avon's Soft Pink bubble bath always used to make me feel soooooooo good....I would relax and fall asleep just smelling it.But of course, like all good things, they took it off the market because they needed to make room for NEW    ( ""nasty smelling "" IMHO ) aromas...at least that's the excuse they give when you call them or write to them.So...anyone know of any other nice smelling products or such that may help?Lavender doesn't cut it with me anymore...makes me nauseous and gives me headaches now.Can't even drink the lavender tea...which used to help.There are many essential oils out there, but not sure which would be the best...also not sure of exactly how to use them. Do you put them on your skin? In a pot of boiling water?Thanks in advance to all."

"Newark, New Jersey (CNN) -- Stopped at a red light in a crime-wracked neighborhood of Newark, New Jersey, a 31-year-old woman watched as her friend slumped to the floor after a bullet smashed through the back window of the 31-year-old's Pontiac minivan.""I looked back and there was a gunman walking up on my car,"" said the driver, who declined to be named out of concerns for her safety.""I turned away and he fired two more.""As the shots rang out, she turned the wheel and hit the gas to escape what turned out to be the second fatal shooting that day in Newark, where nearly a sixth of the city's police force was laid off amid budget cuts about two years ago.And Newark is by no means unique in implementing police cutbacks to save city money. Meanwhile, violent crime soared 18% nationwide last year, marking the country's first rise since 1993, while property crime also spiked for the first time in a decade.""Hurry up, I can't breathe,"" mouthed wounded Bronique McLeod, after the gunman unloaded three rounds at the minivan where she was sitting with her friends just before midnight on October 1.The group then raced toward Newark's University Hospital, but the 24-year-old mother of two began to lose consciousness.One of the bullets had punctured her lung, her family said later.""When they got her on the gurney she kept saying 'I'm dying, I'm dying,'"" the driver recalled. ""'Please don't let me die. I have two kids.'""McLeod hung on until about 3 a.m. the next day, just hours after another victim died in a hail of gunfire in an unrelated incident about a mile away in the city's South Ward.Her death is one of at least 71 homicides so far this year in cash-strapped Newark, where police say they have reorganized after more than 160 police officers were cut from the force in November 2010. Last year the city tallied 74 murders through October, while violent crime soared despite earlier drops in the first years of Mayor Cory Booker's administration.Police expenditures in Newark have since declined every year for the last three years, according to the city's business administrator, Julien X. Neals, leaving cops to sustain public services with decreasing resources.Analysts say the trend isn't unique.""Most cities have cut back since 2008 and the recession, though some more than others,"" said Gregory Minchak, a spokesman for the National League of Cities.Municipal administrators nationwide have since struggled to fill budget gaps amid declines in state aid, a sputtering economy, high employment and slowly rising costs in things like health care and public pensions.According to the Washington-based cities organization, the effects of the financial crisis are also ""increasingly evident in city property tax revenues in 2012,"" after dropping 3.9% nationwide last year and thereby bringing in fewer dollars for municipal services.In short, the overall pie has gotten smaller, say city officials who point to the hundreds of public sector layoffs in Newark in 2010.""We've been in process of reducing our expenses pretty aggressively for the last three years,"" said Neals, who touted improvements in the city's tax collection efforts to help with the revenue side of the equation.""Naturally there's a period where the rubber hits the road and there's not that much left to cut.""But last year Newark ended up with an $18 million surplus in state aid, prompting Republican Gov. Chris Christie to state that he wasn't happy with the city's 2012 requests for more assistance.""I don't need New Jersey's largest city in any more financial trouble than it's in already,"" the governor told reporters earlier this month, dispatching state officials to ""force budget cuts.""Still, in 2010, Newark's mayor said police layoffs were an ""unfortunate situation that was entirely avoidable,"" and blamed the cuts on an unwillingness by police unions to negotiate needed reductions in the wake of the financial crisis. Booker said improvements in technologies and partnerships with federal agencies would help in the fight against crime, and pledged to sustain the number of officers patrolling the streets.But city police union vice president James Stewart has argued that both patrols and detective squads have since been reduced, and that ""all the technology in the world won't replace the bodies you need to respond to crime"" and build proactive policing.Meanwhile, town and city halls in places including Detroit, Michigan; Jacksonville, Florida; Kansas City, Missouri; and Scranton, Pennsylvania, have tentatively put public sector jobs on the chopping block this year to help fill budget gaps.In January, the mayor of crime-ridden Camden, New Jersey, nearly halved its police force while cutting close to a third of its fire department in an effort to close a $26.5 million budget deficit.And as America's fiscal health continues to assume center stage on the campaign trail, how the nation will deal with its debts in the days after November is largely expected to play out in some way on the streets of cities like Newark, Detroit and Camden.A silver lining may be that it's finally forcing the discussion.""We're now having that frank public conversation about what do we want from government and how much do we want to pay for it,"" said Brookings Institution fellow Tracy Gordon.Law enforcement typically makes up large portions of most municipal budgets and is often considered a prime target for cutbacks.""Every department is facing the same kind of issues of downsizing,"" said Newark Police Director Samuel DeMaio.""Everybody has significantly less amount of police officers and you know there has to be a point where that comes to an end.""Newark residents such as Latasha Watson, who was a close friend of McLeod's, say they've become frustrated with the response from police, though they are equally disturbed by the so-called ""snitch code"" that keeps neighborhood witnesses quiet and away from authorities out of fear of retribution.Newark is listed as one of only a handful of New Jersey cities that maintain gangs with more than 200 members, according to a state survey. ""I know (police) are overwhelmed,"" Watson said. ""People are dying but we want cops on the street doing something,"" she added.Earlier this month, police arrested a 42-year-old city resident who is suspected in McLeod's murder.SOURCE: http://www.cnn.com/2012/10/28/us/new-jersey-newark-crime/index.html?hpt=us_c2"
PREG	multiple cysts during ivf	I just underwent my first IVF attempt. During the retrieval process I was told that most of the follicles they removed were actually cysts, and only three were mature eggs. Out of those three, two fertilized and were transferred on day 2, but no pregnancy resulted. My question is, if all of the cysts were removed during the retrieval process, will I produce more cysts if I try again, or would I only produce eggs since the cysts were all removed?

TRMT	Would travel immunizations cause lump in arm pit?	I received a Tetnus, Hep A, and Typhoid shot last Thursday (all in the same arm) and I have noticed a lump about the size of a golf ball in my arm pit.    It is painful when I touch it.    When I put my arm down, you can tell I have swelling.    I have been traveling all this week and will be out of the country for 10 days (Nicaragua).    Should this cause me some concern and should I see a Dr. before I leave on Thursday?
FAML	my 6 yr old boy cries all the time, should i be worried	"My 6 yr old boy cries all the time.    It doesnt matter what the subject is, where we are, or how we try to handle the ""emotional outbreaks"", he cries over, what seems like, anything.    Im very concerned about his behavior because Im not sure what the underlying problem is and how to handle it.    He is our middle child, so we thought that if we created more 1 on 1 time with him, it would help.    I have tried taking privledges, sending him to be by himself in another room, even trying to figure out whats bothering him.....nothing has worked.    When i ask him to talk about his feelings, he says "" I dont know"".    His behavior has made it to where it is very difficult to do things, anywhere from going out on family outings to bonding with him.    I love my son and want the best for him, but my failing efforts are frustrating! Any advice?I should also mention that this ""behavior"" has been going on for close to 2 years now.This discussion is related toMy 6 year old cries all the time.."

SOCL	Cyst on head? Very curious	"Ever since I can remember I have had this lump on the left side of my head. Right where my temple is. If I get stressed, cry really hard, or hang upside down (Where pressure starts to come into my head) it swells up. I went to the doctor a couple years ago and the nurse wanted to ""lance"" it or something. Stick a needle in it to drain it. Well my dad said no way, you don't even know what it is for sure. So then the doctor did a cat scan and thinks it's just a cyst and didn't do anything about it. Well when it swells up it gets very painful and large. And other times its barely noticeable. Though I can always feel it by touching it. Right now the past couple days it's been really sore. When I open my mouth wide it hurts. I'm afraid and don't know what to do about this.This discussion is related toSebaceous Cyst on scalp."

FAML	Sever violent behavior in my 7 yr. old girl	"My daughter    is increasingly acting out in violent ways towards me (I am a single parent) and nothing seems to help.    I have tried every kind of time out imaginable, restraining her, and even just ignoring her.She will jump on me, grabbing my throat, scratching, kicking, hitting, slapping, and biting.    She will throw chairs, ice packs, my purse, or just about anything in reach.    She will slam doors and scream.Other behavior/attitude concerns are: she doesn't want to leave the house, either for school or grocery shopping, or simply to make friends in our neighborhood - she has asked me to ""not pressure her"" that she will make friends when she is ready to.She has locked herself in her room before to avoid going to school.She can go on for _hours_ about how 'hard' her life is...listing extremely trivial things...she got tagged it at school with her friends, she stubbed her toe the other day...things like that.I have tried listening sympathetically, as well as telling her to stop the negativity and talk about something positive.She says that she is not sleeping well, that her ""thoughts won't stop thinking"" so she can fall asleep easier.She has been in therapy for years already, I called the police this morning, what could be the cause/solution to this kind of behavior?Please understand, my daughter is bright, verbally precocious, and capable of holding it together at school etc.She doesn't seem able to know what makes her so angry, or able to take any responsibility for her actions.    She says that I ""make her"" throw things, hit, scream, etc. She will completely turn around when others are around, acting as if everything is fine/normal etc.    When I say no it's not, she flies off the handle again as soon as we are alone.She has seen me abused by her paternal grandmother - I left her, got my daughter in therapy, etc.    I know that some anger is normal - but this is not.There is history of mental illness in her family, father was bi-polar, his sister has sever emotional problems, their mother is extremely violent, but again, a charmer when she wants to be, possibly sociopathic?    But I know for certain that her father was schizophrenic.I don't know what to do, at this point her therapist is even out of suggestions.    I plan to take her in to the County Hospital today for an evaluation - I just can't think of anything else to do.What could be causing this?"

SOCL	Obama staged Newtown shooting	"Obama staged Newtown shooting with 'crisis actors,' says professor who is totally not a crackpotA communication professor known for conspiracy theories has stirred controversary at Florida Atlantic University with claims that last month's Newtown, Conn., school shootings did not happen as reported Ã¢ € ” or may not have happened at all.Moreover, James Tracy asserts in radio interviews and on his memoryholeblog.com. that trained ""crisis actors"" may have been employed by the Obama administration in an effort to shape public opinion in favor of the event's true purpose: gun control. [...]Tracy said he believes the deaths at Sandy Hook may have resulted from a training exercise. ""Was this to a certain degree constructed?"" he said. ""Was this a drill?These are obviously good, solid, in-no-way-absurd questions that must be addressed. Right after we address whether the moon is maybe made of cheese, where Elvis has been hiding himself all these years, and how the foreign country of Kenyan Hawaii snuck native son Barack Obama into the White House in order to take over America with socialist Muslimism.Okay, yes. At first glance, these might seem like ridiculous questions, which is why the university has boldly distanced itself from the professor by insisting that he ""does not speak for the university"" and his website is ""not affiliated with FAU in any way.""But lest you think that this lunatic is, you know, a lunatic, he addresses that:""I describe myself as a scholar and public intellectual,"" he said, ""interested in going more deeply into controversial public events. Although some may see [my theories] as beyond the pale, I am doing what we should be doing as academics.""See? He's not a crackpot.

SOCL	slowing down on marijuana/counseling	"I've been with my boyfriend for a year now. for the first seven months he was on probation (for hard drugs, which he no longer uses) when we met so he was forced to be sober.now that he's no longer on probation he has started smoking pot multiple times every day. he can't simply enjoy any activity without being high. that being said, I have absolutely no issue with the occasional recreational use of marijuana. I've smoked with him and would not care if he was only getting high every few days. I do have an issue when someone I care about considers pot to be their main priority in life.I care about him a lot and I hate knowing what our relationship was like before he began relying on pot to get him through the day. it seems like that person I got into a relationship with has changed.he's reluctant to go to couples counseling to help us come to some kind of an agreement (and other more normal communications issues which I think could be very easily remedied) he's gone to counseling before (by himself) and hated itso, honestly: do you think someone with an addictive background can ever just ""slow down"" on something? if I continue to allow him to smoke is he always going to struggle with overuse of the drug?I think the hardest part is knowing that he gave up hard drugs. I know he's able to quit certain things. he just doesn't view smoking non stop as destructive. he is willing to go to the library with me to get books about communication etc and try to work on things ourselves, but I don't know if that is any kind of a substitute for an unbiased therapist giving us advice on our specific problems."

PREG	Is there a possibility I could still be pregnant?	I had went in to be assessed for the Flu.    I did not want to take anything if I could be pregnant.    My last period was Feb. 2nd-4th.    At the time of the appointment, it would have been 5 weeks since my period.    I am not sure when I ovulated.    I took digital ovulation tests from days 11-18.    I never got a surge but did not continue to test after this point...too expensive!    I could have ovulated after day 18,    Cycles run avg. 28-30d.    Anyways, all urine tests have been negative.    Dr. drew a blood hcg that day.    It came back 3.    He told me there is no pregnancy.    However, I have gained 5lbs, slight nausea at times, breast tenderness, and abdomen feels very bloated.    Could I still be pregnant but, at this point, have a severely low HCG.    I have had friends whose levels were low and urine tests did not confirm until 7-14 weeks...I want to be patient and see what happens.    So far, today is day 39 past LMP.

SOCL	House group agrees on immigration reform	"Washington (CNN) - After months of intense negotiations, a bipartisan U.S. House group has reached an ""agreement in principle"" on immigration reform, according to Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida, one of the GOP members of the group.A Democratic aide familiar with the discussions confirmed that all the members signed on and told CNN both Democrats and Republicans ""will now run the whole package past their respective leadership and colleagues"" and aim to formally introduce legislation at the beginning of June.Diaz-Balart declined to get into the details of the deal, but said, ""there's going to be a lot of differences in a lot of areas,"" from a bipartisan measure working its way through the Senate.""Filing a real bipartisan bill Ã¢ € “ a serious, enforceable commonsense bill is, I think, a huge step. But it's the first step of the process Ã¢ € ¦ a very important step,"" Diaz-Balart told reporters outside the House floor Thursday.The four Republican members of the House group include Diaz-Balart, Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho, and Rep. John Carter and Rep. Sam Johnson, both of Texas.The four Democrats are Reps. Xavier Becerra and Zoe Lofgren, both of California, Rep. Luis Gutierrez of Illinois, and Rep. John Yarmuth of Kentucky.Carter told reporters earlier on Thursday that the last sticking point involved whether the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States would get access to government health care benefits. It's unclear how the group resolved that issue.Carter also said that because Republican and Democratic negotiators were unable to come to an agreement on a program overseeing guest workers, the group decided to leave that issue out of the bill. But both planned to offer their proposals separately, likely as amendments to the main legislation.Both sides differed on how many worker visas should be allowed for construction companies and other industries relying on low skilled labor workers.House Speaker John Boehner pledged that any immigration bill would move through the appropriate committees in the House before any vote by the full chamber.A key test for the bipartisan deal will come when the House Judiciary Committee takes it up, because that panel includes a significant number of conservatives, who have pledged to block any measure that allows a path to citizenship for undocumented workers.Boehner signaled he wanted the House to have its own version to negotiate a final immigration bill with the Democratic-led Senate.""I continue to believe that the House needs to deal with this and the House needs to work its will,"" Boehner said on Thursday.The Senate plan is now being considered by the Judiciary Committee.SOURCE: http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/05/16/breaking-house-reaches-immigration-agreement/?hpt=hp_t2"

DISE	CA27-29	Visit this week to oncologist.    CA27-29 still going down, (test three weeks from last one), but decision was to discontinue Gemzar and carboplatin, (bad reaction to the carboplatin six weeks ago after being on it for 9 months,alternating with Taxotere).    Because of the L-glutamine supplement working after last taxotere to control/eliminate mouth sores, doctor asked if I would go back to taxotere every three weeks instead of every six weeks with another chemo in between.    So, now I will start next week on an every three-week cycle of taxotere with the addition of Avastin. I understand that Avastin has recently been approved for breast cancer.    It seems as if it can have some horrible side-effects in 2% of the people, (congestive heart failure, stroke, lung hemhorrage), and as I seem to get every side-effect from every chemo I have been on, this is a little scary!.    Any information on Avastin from those who may have taken it?    (I was diagnosed with stage IV estrogen receptor positive BC with metastises to the bones in 2004, controlled by Arimidex for 27 months, but then spread to lungs and liver in Jan2007, so had to start chemo at that point.    CA27-29 was 9500 before starting taxotere and carboplatin, now down to 135 and I have returned to work full-time)

The neurologist agreed to see him and they stopped the Diamox. He set up an appt to have the eyes diolated again. Then on Friday he is going to have a spinal tap done. The neurologist feels my son might not have pseudotumor cerebri but chronic daily headaches. I am concerned that this might be the shunt malfunctioning and or the start of chiari.    He doesn't see a chiari on the CT. We don't have a recent MRI. Any thoughts?!

DISE	Elderly father can't stay awake	My father is 95 and has been in generally good health.    He has been getting tired easily but all of a sudden he can't wake up.

It's very hard to wake him up but when I do, he just tries to focus and then goes back to sleep.Everyone says he's just getting old but there has to be an actual reason for this.

FAML	Desperately worried	My oldest daughter is 10yrs old.    She has always been a handful.    For years now, I have suspected that she may have ADHD.    But everyone just kept telling me that she was just a hard headed independant girl.    Over the last 1 1/2 -2 years, she has gradually been getting worse.    She dosn't listen to my husband or myself.    She wants to do what she wants to do and God help any one who tries to make her do otherwise.    But in the past 3 - 4 months, she has gotten completely out ofcontrol.    She is very, very mean and hateful to my youngest daughter who is 8yrs old.    She is constantly hitting on her, screaming at her and saying very cruel things to her.    almost every minute their around each other.    My youngest adores her sister and dosn't understand what she did to make her sister hate her.    I try to console her and tell her that its not her.    We can't get her to do anything we tell her to.    She has started treating people outside of the family the same now too. She has lost a lot of friends over it and has been banned from even going to certain peoples houses.    She dosn't show any consideration for anyone or anything else.    We have tried every punishment we can think of and have been advised to try.    nothing works.    In fact, lately, punishing her only intensifies her anger and outbursts.    It has carried over to her school work now, and even her teacher is having a very hard time getting her to do what she needs to do instead of what she wants to do.    I was researching ODD and she shows signs of every one of the symptoms that was listed.    Please help me.    I don't know if it is something that I am doing wrong or if it is for medical reasons.    My family has been through a lot over the last couple of years,    My husband and I had some problems for a while and it got pretty ugly.    But that was over a year ago and we have come a long way since then.If you can help me with some advise I'd greatly appreciate it.    Thank you.
PREG	Nadia Isabel is here and we are so thrilled!!	"Hello ladies,As you all know, I was scheduled for an induction Friday am.    However, little miss decided to make her entrance Thursday at 11:24 am.    I was very glad to go into labour naturally.I woke up at 3:45, just feeling off.    By 4:30 I was sure I was in labour so I woke my dh, called l & d and headed over.    By the time we got there the contractions were 4-5 minutes apart.Once in l & d, the ob team checked in on me, because of the complications with my ds they and the peds team were on standby for when I actually delivered.    I refused an epi at first, but about an hour later, after a great, informative discussion with my nurse I decided to have one.    My main concern was having pain relief in place if I had complications again.    The epi did slow down my contractions, but my doc just decided to let it unfold, I guess a lot of docs will give pitocin when that happens.    When I was 9 cm she broke my water and I was ready to push.I pushed for a little over two hours.    At one point my epi needle came out so I was au natural for the actual delivery.    I was beginning to think I would have medical intervention again....my doc kept saying ""You are making progress, slow progress but let's try for another 10 minutes....""    And just as they were entering the room, I pushed her out.    (did have a small episiotomy).    Yeah for a family doc who stayed with me through out my labour and talked me through all the hard parts.The peds team whisked her away, pronounced her perfect and had her back in my arms in just a few moments.    She weighed 6lbs 10 oz.    She looks just like her big sister.My husband put her on my bare chest when she was about 20 minutes old and she literally crawled up and latched on to my breast.    The nurse told me that she had seen that on video, but had not seen it in person ever.    And it was a sign how easy nursing was going to be.    She is a nursing fiend.At about 1 hour, still in l & d I started to bleed.    They tried uterine massage and then gave me hemobate which did stop the bleeding.    I was very glad as I knew the next step was the or.She has some jaundice, she was under the lights for abotu 8 hours.    That seems to be clearing up now, she is nice and alert, nursing well and we feel so very blessed.Thank you to all my cyber sisters who comforted me when I miscarried, gave me great advice and rejoiced with me when I got that bfp.Pictures are on my facebook site.    My name is Ciel Crosby, just add me as a friend and you will have access."

DEMO	Worried about abnormal vagina?	"I'm really sorry to post this, but I'm worried that I'm not normal ""down there"". I've looked through a lot of pictures to find something that at least SORT OF looks like me but I've found nothing. I've never had sex or anything like that. Never down there unless I'm in the shower for general hygeine. I have a boyfriend but we don't do anything. Partly because I don't want any of that til after marriage, and partly because I'm afarid I'm abnormal.From what I've seen online, I don't think I have much of a labia minor, very small, that seem like they're ""attached"" to the clit... Nothing really ""opens up"" that much, like I've seen in pictures/videos. It's just all right there, closed up and odd. I find it all a bit uncomfortable to touch.Is this all normal from what you know?I have pictures, but I'm reluctant to show them or freak anyone out. If anyone doesn't mind taking a look, can someone tell me from a picture if it's normal (or just from what I've described?) I can't go to a doctor because I can't afford one, and even if I could, I've been told that they place their fingers up there and I'm afraid that'd hurt or they'd break something.I just want to feel normal. Does this sound normal?"

FAML	What is going on with my 4 year old!	"My 4 year old son has always had a lot of energy.    He runs more than other kids, yells more than other kids and is extreme in all behaviors.    He started saying words at 10 months, is very bright, and is top in his class at preschool academically.    He poses the most thoughtful questions, loves to read, do homework, etc.    Because of his impulsivity and hyperactivtiy I thought he had ADHD from the age of 2 to 4.    But I didn't know because at about 3 1/2 he started some other odd behaviors.    He was sniffing his nose constantly, all day, everyday.    He would wipe his mouth over and over and lick his lips until they were raw.    He would make up weird words and demand that we use them like call me enopi, or this tool isn't a spatula it's a mahu, or whatever.    He would yells out suddenly or scream repeatedly.    He was pretty agressive with his twin 19 month old sisters, and started talking about a wolf in the house that he was scared of.    Then I started thinking he had tourettes, or anxiety disorder.    Suddenly at about 4 he really mellowed out.    I was watching what he ate more, feeding him Attentive Child vitamins along with Omega 3 vitamins and I really started noticing a difference.    He still is a boy, but maybe more a ""normal"" boy.    He has been socializing better, he has been easier to discipline and he has been getting stickers in preschool each time.    His sniffing stopped completely as did almost all the other above explained behaviors.    On Tuesday I took him to get his 4 year shots.    I only got Dtap, and varicella.    On Wednesday morning he woke up and my old, bizarre child was back. The one that has been gone for about 2 months now.    All of the behaviors I explained have completely come back.    He hasn't missed a day of vitamins, he is still eating well, mostly organic food, and the only thing I can think of are this stupid shots.    He didn't get a sticker in preschool, and my husband and in laws noticed a change as well.    Today is Saturday and he is still engaging in these odd behaviors.    I am sick to my stomach and utterly confused as to what is going on.    I thought previously that he must have grown out of these behaviors and I was ever so grateful.    Now I sit in tears listening to him in his room making weird humming, munching, swirling, spitting sounds, talking to himself, repeating phrases, etc.    The odd thing is we just came from a BBQ where he behaved very well playing in a playhouse with another child.    He didn't scream out there, repeat phrases, or anything else...what is happening to my angel?     Please, please help me!    I am desperate!"

SOCL	persistent low grade fever?	I'm 25yr old female and ive been having low grade fever (37.5-38C) for the last 5 months with no significant symptoms (except for very mild nasal congestion which might be alergic(allergic)). I'm on Epilim for epilepsy and I am not taking any other medication. I don't feel sick at all, only a bit tired and chilly which is probably due to the fever itself. Any ideas what it can be?When I was a small kid (3 years old) I had a fever for more than a year (38-40C), I didn't have any symptoms back then too. My parents took me to many doctors and I finally ended up in the hospital where they did many tests to find out what was going on (LN biopsy included). They found nothing and concluded that I was healthy and in my case fever didn't necessarily mean sickness. My parents say that my temperature got back to normal by the time I started primary school and it pretty much stayed normal with ocassional break outs- for example I could have been 'perfectly healthy' but I would wake up in the middle of the night feeling feverish. Sometimes I checked my temperature and it was 40C but by the time I woke up the next morning fever was gone and I was fine. However, those 'episodes' got pretty rare after high school and now I can't even remember when I had the last one.I know that what medicine 22 years ago considered healthy might not be so today but maybe somebody here has some ideas or similar experiences? :D The low-grade fever that I am experiencing now is not making me feel sick, which is weird because sometimes when I have a cold and the same 38C I feel just awful and have no energy. I can study as usual and do all other things and most of the time I dont even feel that my temperature is higher than it's supposed to be until I check.

DEMO	At age 20, I had to have my Ovary removed	About a week or two after my 20th birthday, I was having real bad pains in my abdomin(abdomen). After a few hours of pain, I finally went to the hospital to get checked out. My left ovary was about almost the size of a golf ball. There was a cyst that had ruptured and caused about a pint of blood internal bleeding. I went to a Korean hospital. (I'm in the U.s. military, stationed in Korea) The doctors cut me from one side to the other above my public line, just to remove one ovary. Are they supposed to cut me that long for just one ovary? Also, with my ovary being removed, affect me as well as my body in the long run? I know that I am already experiencing weight gain, depression, and the majority of the symptoms that I have read of. I know that my surgery has effected some of the decisions that I have made, is that a result of the surgery also? Curious and looking for answers..
DISE	Hystorectomy and Foot Drop	Hello to all,My mother had a hysterectomy procedure done at the Northwick Park Hospital in London on 1 June 2007 under the care of Miss J. Pitkin.Soon after the opperation, she noticed that she could not lift her left foot off the bed. She also could not move her foot upwards when sitting on a chair and could not stand of walk. Sensation on the left thigh, leg and foot was not same as the right. She kept falling down in the hospitals and nurses and junior doctors kept saying that it was either sciatica or a compressed nerve, but it will go away on its own. But it cannot be sciatica, becuase she has never had it on the right leg, and she does not have any pain.We asked on seeing Miss Pitkin or her registrar who could say what had caused this problem, but no matter how much we insisted, we saw neither of them.Finally, she was discharged on 5 June, and at home she is a mess both physically and mentally, and so far there is no improvement.Meanwhile, no specialist has come to see her, and although I put in an informal complaint, we still have not seen Miss Pitkin to get an explaination.My mother has been the patient of Miss Pitkin, and she does not know what she looks like. She has never seen her, not prior to the operation and not after this problem.I would be grateful for any information on this subject. What could have caused this, and how can it be treated, if at all it is treatable.

GOAL	Implant Crown Hurts	I had two implants on # 12 and #13 and when the doctor put on the implant crown it felt like my mouth was in a vice.    It was affecting all the upper teeth like it was pushing on themand it was very painful. Very painful. Extremely.    The contact felt too tight between 12 and 13,    but the doctor said that it was fine.    The dental floss broke when I flossed.    I finally had him remove the implant crowns on 12 and 13.    I went to another doctor in another area 10 miles away.    He redid everything and, to my dismay, the same pain occured. The contact, however, was fine, and flossing was easy.    I went back the the oral surgeon who placed the implants and he checked everything and said the implants were perfect, and that it was what was on top of the implants.    How could my teeth have the exact same problem with two totally differnt doctors who placed two differnt sets of crowns.    Any advice would be greatly appreciated.    I'm so miserable. And they're giving up on me. I can't live with this pain.    It's unbearable. Thanks.

My hCG levels thereafter were steadily rising, except that when I went in for my 5wks6d ultrasound, the MD could not find a yolk sac and my hCG numbers came back extremely low - 656 (when the prior hCG that was done 9 days before that was at 391). MD is suspecting either another ectopic or miscarriage. I'm extremely worried and frustrated at the same time - DH and I have been trying to conceive for 2 years now! Has anyone had any of these symptoms and go on to have a viable pregnancy?

FAML	6 yr old and tantrums	"I am at the end of my rope with my daughter. She is six years old and in the first grade. She is described (by teachers, doctors, etc) as a ""bright, sweet girl"" but . . .She is prone to these temper tantrum/rages. If she doesn't get what she wants, if she hears a no, if she has to wait on something, if she gets frustrated, if she is not the center of attention the water works start. The tears and crying are mild in comparison to the angry, escalating reactions. For example, when the teacher did not call on her, she got upset, kicked her desk, pushed it away, yelled out, screamed and cried and eventually hurt herself by flailing before the teacher could get to her and get her out of the classroom.Another time, she was in ""cool down"" in the hallway because she was already upset and crying and she got angry and threw her eyeglasses and stomped her feet.At home, she will throw toys, clothes, stomp feet, beat the walls and scream that ""I hate you,"" to her father and I.Since school has started, she has been taken out of class and put in ""cool out"" in the principal's office three times. School has been in session for three weeks, and the three visits to ""cool out"" were within a span of five days.She is told the rules before hand, and when she breaks them, it is explained what she did wrong and she acknowledges it. (""I yelled at Daddy. That wasn't nice."") However, when she is punished (sent to bed, privileges revoked) she will instantly not accept the blame. Instead it becomes my fault, my husband's fault, the teacher's fault, anyone's fault but hers. And we are doing it not because she did something wrong, but because ""you're mean and you don't love me.""These attacks are not infrequent. They happen regularly at least every other day. My husband and I don't know what to do. We recently moved and she started a new school, but she had these problems before the move and school change, however, so I don't believe that is all of her problem.Are there any suggestions to help us? We have an appointment scheduled for a psychologist but that's two weeks out. Could there be something medical that I could ask her family physician to look at? Am I missing anything or are there other details and information I should be gathering to give to her psychologist when we go?"

TRMT	Does this mean surgery?	Hello. I am 43 years old. I had a tubal years ago, so no more children. I had blood tests done to see if I am menopausal (results not back). I recently had a vaginal ultrasound because of heavy, irregular periods and pain during periods, in abdomen, in pelvis, and during intercourse.    I blamed this pain on fibromyalgia (diagnosed 9 yrs ago). My test results showed 'samll uterine fibroid, some ovary cysts, and thickened endometrium.    Gyn. gave me progesterone (sp?).    She said this should help with periods.    I didn't tell her about all the pain because I blamed it on the FMS, but after researching this, I realize the pain is from these problems. Does this mean surgery? Thank you for your reply.

FAML	Bad Behavior	I have a friend that has two children, the girl is 2 and the boy is 3.    The little boy displays very bad behavior at times.    He throws tantrums, kicks, screams, breaks things, and even talks back.    You can tell him to do something and that if he doesn't the consequences and he will tell you that he will do the same consequences to you.    He is about to get put out of his school, because he has kicked the wall in, spit on the other kids as well as the teachers, he breaks toys, and hits the other kids.    She doesn't know what to do with him at this point.    She's a single mom and doesn't have much help from their father.    She is thinking he may have ADHD or may need some kind of help from a doctor, possibly medicine.    Can you recommend anything at all?    I try to help as much as possible.    But she really needs help.    Thank You

DEMO	Ovarian Cyst	my sister called me today and is very worried about a cyst she has on her right ovary.    she's been trying to get pregnant for almost a year now.    her obgyn says that the reason she can't get pregnant is because of the ovarian cyst on her right ovary and that she should be find once    it is removed.    he believes that the cyst does not have any entwined blood vessels or anything, so he should be able to save the ovary.my question is:    even if there is a cyst on her right ovary, shouldn't the left ovary still be healthy and ovulating?    we have an aunt who had problems with ovarian cysts, but the doctor is saying it's probably because she was on the birth control pill for about four years, but i'm wondering if maybe it isn't hereditary.    i don't know what to tell her and she's really worried.    she's having her surgery at the end of this month, so we'll see what happens.has this happened to anyone else?    can anyone offer advice?    thanks!

DISE	Post Pneumonia, why severe pain?	I was hospitalised with left side bacterial pneumonia and fluid around the lung. I was in for 4 days on IV antibiotics.    I felt ok for a week, then felt worse. Went to my doc who after examination, said it had probably not cleared and gave me a 10 day course of antibiotics.    I finished these felt no better and got a chest x ray, all clear. Still having chest pain, very strong pain in lower back on left side which radiates.It keeps me awake at night, i take pain relief and use heat packs to alleviate it.Doc thinks it is just 'post pneumonia' muscle pain.    A small act such as brushing my hair or climbing the stairs leaves me with muscle ache. I am 42, non smoker and feel rubbish. Any suggestions? It has now been 5 weeks since I was diagnosed.

DEMO	Is this a yeast/fungal or bacterial infection? Or worse?	Day 1: Recently right after I showered, I felt some dry discomfort on my the end of my labia minora so I applied some clotrimazole that the doctor gave me the last time I had an infection. But then when I went to use the restroom a couple times and pass a movement, I pushed to get the bowel movement and when I did that I felt the discomfort extending throughout one side of my vuvlva, the right side of my labia majora and outside my labia minora. I just ignored it though.Day 2: This day I went to school and felt that the discomfort got worse and although I still retained that dry discomfort, there was also    a stinging pain that would occur every now and then when ever I moved, accompanied with that it felt like my vulva had on the right side had been stretched or something along those lines so it burned as well. So I still applied the clotrimazole cream as directed.Day 3: normally this starts getting better by now but to me it began to feel more irritated and hurt worse. The pain on day 2 was subtle and still bearable, in fact the cream had kind of a soothing affect when applied but when I wiped it off after using the restroom or after it wore off hours later the pain cam back. Anyway on the third day when I moved a certain way the pain would become really intense, so much to the point that I thought I had some kind of long cut down there. So I took a mirror and checked it out but didnt find a sign of a cut and I wasnt bleeding.Day 4: Im getting worried today that I might have something other than a yeast infection because to my knowledge, such an infection schouldnt feel like someone cut me down there. Or it could simply be because of the stress I applied on the first day, nonetheless Im worried.My concerns and Notes: First of all, Im doubting its any form of STD cause Ive never had sex, still a virgin, and dont have a boyfriend    and I havent done anything sexual either. Im not sure if the cream is helping or hurting the problem because it should have healed some by now.Some advice from a medical professional would be much appreciated. Advice from anyone else unless theyve gone through this, Im going to ignore.
DEMO	Period Two Days late...	My period is two days late. I am a virgin and the last time I gave and recieved oral sex was before my period last month. But after that period, I went to the doctor's to get rid of a vaginal odour and I was taking some antibiotics to get rid of it and they worked.

TRMT	Chinese diet tip could keep breast cancer from mushrooming	Chinese diet tip could keep breast cancer from mushroomingThe results of this new study about possible breast cancer preventative could grow on you like a fungus. Apparently, women who eat just a third of an ounce of fresh mushrooms every day could decrease their chances of developing breast cancer by a whopping 64 percent!Even though this study comes from China Ã¢ € “ and you know how I feel about things from China Ã¢ € “ I'm inclined to be encouraged. After all, before China became known for its deadly imports, substandard pharmaceutical ingredients, toothpaste and milk products, it was also one of the birthplaces of natural cures.In fact, this study found that the daily dose of mushrooms combined with regular consumption of green tea yielded a risk decrease of Ã¢ € “ hold on to your button caps Ã¢ € “ 90 percent!Obviously, there must be something in the Chinese diet that's working right, because breast cancer rates in that country are significantly lower than in countries in the west Ã¢ € “ by as much as five times.DR.D.

GOAL	Circulation in right leg	"I am 6'-1"" and weigh 172 pounds and I am a highly competitive runner and nordic skier.    For the past two years, when I run, or train at a high level of intensity (ie. intervals or racing) the blood pressure in my right leg drops dramatically, thus causing a tremendous pain/burn in my quadracept (upper and lower), and calf - It feels like a 40 pound weight has been attached to my leg, ultimately forcing me to stop.    When I do stop, it takes a minute for my leg to return to normal.    The doctors I've consulted call this sensation ""claudication"", but have yet to find out what is causing the disorder.    I have gone to message therapy, worked on various stretches, and gone through several batteries of tests (treadmill/stress, angiogram, MRA/MRI, sonogram), yet to no avail.    Speculation ranges from chronic compartment syndrome of the upper leg, which I have found very little information, to overdeveloped adductor or quadricept muscles, to even the possibility that my femoral or illiac arteries are being banded by my muscles across the ingunial ligament - No one knows!    I have reached the point of maximum frustration and I do not know what to do do next - Can you help me?    Have you ever heard of this problem?    How do I fix it without stopping?"

I now have pubic and underarm hair, a relatively average voice, and definitely have grown in the past year. Here's where my question lies however: is my bone growth and facial features done changing? I have the smallest wrists out of any guy in my grade, however some of the longest hands (not necessacarily the hands withthe most girth), I have size 11 feet but relatively small ankles. I do not have nearly as much muscle mass as most of my friends, but I have been lifting for a year and have added a good 20 lbs of weight. Also, everyone says facial wise, I'm one of the youngest looking, I'm a senior and people mistake me for a freshman or even younger. I think this has to do with a small bit of fat on my cheeks and a small jaw. Will my face keep developing and will my jaw become bigger? I don't have much facial hair, I've never had to shave in my life. Also my head is quite large compared to the size of my neck, which also is very small compared to my friends. Why is It that I am of average weight and heigth compared to my friends yet all the features that are supposed to be accentuated in men are not up to par? Any help is much appreciated, thank you!"

TRMT	Hysterectomy/ovaries removed -14 months later  NOW menopause??	Hello,     I had one ovary and the uterus removed June 06.    No menopuase symptoms.    The last ovary removed on Feb 5, 2008. No menopause symptoms.     Suddenly this year, sometime in April 09 - I began getting what I thought were hot flashes.        Here and there, then lately 11 - 13 times a day.    Is this possible to happen sooooo long after the final removal of my last ovary Feb 2008?    Thank you!
GOAL	dental	I was advised by my dentist to do a briadge according to missing tooth. Two teeths arround missing one didnt bother me but had fillings . After procedure was performed my teeth become cold sensative and    it was hard to drink something even a little bit colder then the mouth temperature or even brush my teeth with a tooth paste.After i visited my doctor and explained him a problem he    reffered me to a gum grafting specialist, but another doctor refused to performe any gum procedure and sent me back to my dentist with advice eighter to replace    the briadge or try    to put the filling alonge the gum area( which wasnt covered deep enough by crown as he explained). my dentist didnt replace but tried to cover the aria by gum,but it wasnt helpfull    enough. ..after going back and force to his office with the same problem for another three months    he finally agreed on making a new briadge,but after numbing the area with more then 10 injections he drilled sooooo much the hard tissue of already decreased in size( with previouse drilling)    tooth so it caused the nerve of the tooth to become damaged to the point that it needed root canel treatment.Second crown preparation procedure was simply the last straw to the life of my tooth..i was so depressed, because my tooth never gave me any problem before i start all the procedures for briadge..The worsest is now ,when he make me pay the root canel $$$$ after i have already paid him 35 grands for the briadge and another tooth under the new briadge he made become also cold sensitive and painfull so i would probably need another tooth treatment for root canel to be done also..can u please advice me what the legal step i can make and do i even have a rights to disscuss with him the money issue after all the phisical and emotional demage he did to me. He is very mean and rude the way he talks to people and has very low tolarance to people pain and problems.

DEMO	Where to go next?	I have had small pink/red spots around my virginal area on and off for over a year now, they aren't very noticeable but I always get 2-3 at a time every month or so (around periods). They either appear on the flaps or within the pubic area. I often feel them coming on when I start to get itchy below, when there out they itch and are sore and normally take 5-7 days to dissapear again.My doctor told me to go to a GU clinic where all my tests came back clear, they said it didn't look like herpes either as the spots don't have heads. I have now been told that they are warts, but look nothing like photos I have seen and I am not convinced.Please help im only 21 and its ruining myself and my boyfriends sex life, they are so annoying!

SOCL	perirectal abscess questions	A few days ago, I went into the ER for incision and drainage of a perirectal abscess. It was packed with iodine gauze and I was sent on my way with antibiotics and pain meds.I was instructed to follow up with the referred surgeon the next day, who would take over the care of the packing and surgery I will eventually need. However, the surgeon can't see me for another 2 weeks.I still have the original packing, now 3 days old, and am not sure what to do. I was given no instruction over diet, taking showers, or how long the packing is good for. I called the same ER for help, and the nurse said she didn't know either and hung up on me.I'm responding well to the antibiotics, and the abscess is still draining but the area is still very painful. I can only lie down. In summary:1. How often should the packing be changed?2. What can I eat (the location of the abscess presents obvious difficulties with the need to defecate),

GOAL	constant pain after crown	Hello--I had a crown completed on upper left molar 7 weeks ago.    I had no pain before the crown and had crown done due to advice from my dentist--he said there was a crack on the tooth.    I also had very little/no pain while wearing the temporary crown for three weeks.    I felt enormous, intense pain while the temporary crown was removed and the permanent crown put on.    I have been in pain ever since.    The pain hasn't gotten better or any worse--just a dull, aching pain that makes the entire side of my head hurt.    I returned to the dentist 3 weeks ago and had an    x-ray done--the dentist said it doesn't look like I have an infection.    He applied ice to the affected tooth---shooting pain!    He then said I possibly have reversible pulpitis.    I am not sure if I accurately communicated to him that my pain is constant.    Right now, I take 200 milligrams of ibuprofin every four hours, and my pain is manageable.    But I don't want to live like this any longer if a root canal is inevitable.    I am really hoping that the tooth will get better on its own.    Part of me thinks that the tooth was so aggravated by the permanent crown being put on, that it is just taking forever to heal--but of course I don't know that for sure!    I just want advice whether or not I should seek root canal treatment.    Thank you.

SOCL	Are Sunscreens safe?	Half of all sunscreens, (those using vit A, retinol) have been found to accelerate cancer in mice. The FDA has known this for more than a decade.I use them sometimes but do not nor have ever trusted them. I guess because they can enter the body thru the skin. Tho I do believe too much sunshine like anything, can be harmful I am much more comfortable with Gods creation rather than mans. Maybe Im just old fashioned.What say you?Do you use them.    Will these products come back to bite us or do you feel like they are safe?

SOCL	What does a break mean?	"O.K. I posted a couple of weeks ago. I have been talking to my high school sweetheart. It is complicated because I am getting a divorce, and he is not sure. We had not done anything physical. It was more texting and talking about what the possibilities are. On Monday, I went to lunch with him. After I did not hear from him all weekend, I decided that I did not want to pursue the relationship any farther and told him that I was ready for a physical relationship and he is not, so we should just be friends. I then told him that we can't talk for a while because I need to get myself together and lose the feelings and he needs to figure out what he wants in life. He asked me if the physical part of the relationship was that important to me, and out of honesty, I said yes. About an hour and a half into the conversation, he leaned in a kissed me. Really kissed me. Then he did it again. I could tell he was immediately freaking out. We said out goodbyes and he asked me to be understanding of his time to proccess. It was a huge deal. About ten minutes later, I got a text that said ""How can something feel so wrong and so right at the same time."" Then, he asked if I thought he has betrayed his children. We talked a bit and he told me he needed a couple of days to clear his head. Not necciserily proccess, but just clear his head. The past few weeks have been intense. I obliged and suggested I do the same. I have not contacted him and been giving him his space. My question is this: When a man is clearing his head, are they really just not thinking about anything or are they making decisions or what? I am not all torn up or anything. I am just wanting to know what is going through his head."

Now if I defrost on the fridge, can I still warm it up with boiled water?

Can I heat defrosted milk the same way? Thanks! I couldn't find any info in my breastpump manual.

TRMT	Low B12, High B6	"Hi.My symptoms are numbness on the right side of my body, mainly my hand and foot.    Though in my ""worse"" times it can affect my left.    I have good time and bad as far as coping with the tingles and heavieness.    This has been occuring for 6yrs.    Just this last year I went to talk to docs about it.    I have had MANY tests.    EMG, vascular test, MRI, blood work.    The only abnormalities that came back was a 200pg/ml in B12, SED of 2 mm/hr, and my B6 was in a toxic range.    In May of 2009, I was concerned about my weight(~200lbs) so the PA I saw prescribed me with Phentermine(15mg) and Metformin(500mg).    They made me jittery, so I stopped after one month.    I do not take a multivitamin and I do eat healthy.How am I supposed to cut out B6?    I have been taking 2000ug B12 for 5weeks.Every doc I talk to says I probably have MS.    Should I maybe see a specialist for MS or keep seeing my Neurologist?    When we were going through my test results his only suggestion was to stop taking B6....but I am not taking anything nor eating anything so much that I have such high levels.    It seems there has to be something else going on here.Help, please?"

PREG	PCOS, post depo and ttc, Any suggestions? :D	Hey guys...So, heres the deal; I currently have a 7 month old son and stupidly had two depo shots under our GP's advice after having fallen pregnant with ds on the pill and not wanting to concieve(conceive)to quickly after having him.However, since then I have read many articles about the long term effects that depo can have on fertility. On top of this, I have PCOS, Hashimotos Disease and also a retroverted uterus which are all known to effect fertility.So, dh and I decided that instead of having the next depo shot that we would try for another child, with the knowledge that it could take approx 12 months to conceive.I have not yet had a period since having my last shot over 4 months ago but have been having similar syptoms(symptoms)to those I had whilst pregnant with my son. I've had bloating, pains, a tight abdomen, sore breasts and headaches. No nausea yet though, thank god!!I have taken a hpt which was negative and am planning to visit our GP but until then, I was wondering if anyone else has had a similar experience or if anyone else is able to share their experiences with depo shots and conception?Thanks xx

DEMO	Can you tell your doctor your not treated well or medically by his nurses?	"I was left with no choice but to complain about a group of surly medical personnel at my Cardiac Surgeon Doctor's office. Well, I MUST/NEED to undergo an Echo-Stress test because I desperately need Brain surgery for Trigeminal    Neuralgia, a neuropathic disease. Once...AGAIN! On the day of the Echo-Stress exam I    faced retaliation and was 'ganged' up by 3 female workers. I asked the gal to close the privacy curtain several times, and it was never done. The testing area is for both genders. The head-charge nurse of the office was called into my testing room from several doors away and they 'appeared' to have that knocking around, ganging up of me all planned out due to my previous fax message to the MD.She yelled at me ""do you want to take this test or not?"" Well.. I MUST have that test, or no surgery since I've already had two (2) heart attacks.I fell frozen and very silent and suddenly remembered the un-wanted sexual abuse I endured one hot summer as an adolescent from an family member. It's that same rotten gut feeling, like biting into an apple with a worm inside. My breasts were wide open on that table just like in my bed that morning when I was 12 years old. I froze up! OMG, not only did I endure un-provoked sexual advances from the most cherished male of my family, but my breasts were intentionally left wide open again for the whole world to view me in that vulnerable position AGAIN! I KEPT COVERING MY BREASTS UP and they kept pulling the gown OFF of my breasts! To make matters worst, the younger gal was told to 'take charge' of me and she sand-papered the hell out of my skin. I told them sand-papering was unnecessary ( I have dry-dry skin, and allergic to adhesives) and she took delight in doing it even harder! I still feel the shock of that morning from both experiences, and depressed feelings are haunting me all over & once again. This new experience is just as bad as that summer morning, and even worst, because I kept saying NO< NO< NO!I can't sleep, I'm in worst pain, and    feel as denigrated all over again by my own gender. I also think the charge nurse is a drunk as well as a lesbian. Where do I begin? The last time I complained via FAX to the MD about the surly mentality,    I met this fierce gang of females taking what should be a simple echo-stress test. They also insisted that I leave my purse outside of the testing room which was totally unnecessary as there are hooks on the wall for clothes & purses. I know that if given the chance my purse including all of my IDs would get passed around & ripped off by at least one of them. It's just the attitude in the AIR that one gets, you know the types, those gang mentality's exist in every office setting, and lately more prominent in medical settings. Who should I write to now? The hospital will protect the workers, not the patients, I do not want to sue them, I want a formal apology and they should collectively all lose their jobs. Who should I make an appointment with at the center? The administration, or the doctor again, or should I make a statement to the police department. I had been violated in a doctor's office and this wasn't the first time. It happened the first time I ever saw a gynecologists at 18 years old. The doctor began to talk 'dirty' to me and I quickly left to never return. As females, we must protect ourselves from    men, now we have to protect ourselves from lesbian drunks at our doctors office too at every turn?    Any suggestions would surely help this overwhelming depressed feelings that linger in my loving home."
SOCL	Mad rantings of an insecure woman or justified???	My boyfriend and I have been together for just over 1 Ã‚ ½ yrs. Things for the most part are good, but there are a couple things that have been nagging at meÃ¢ € ¦and IÃ¢ € ™d like some other perspectives. We rarely; if ever fight but there have been a few times where something he has done upsets me or hurts my feelings. In several instances where I was upset or hurt, I have had a hard time getting a response or I get an unsatisfying response.    Here are a couple snippets of the type of things I am talking about:Scenario #1 Ã¢ € “    Ã¢ € œLisaÃ¢ €  a friend from past reconnects with him via    Facebook, a few weeks later, I find out myself that she has been calling him 3-4 nights a week, while he is on his way to work. I ask about itÃ¢ € ¦he says yes she has been callingÃ¢ € ¦he did not realize it has been that muchÃ¢ € ¦she seems lonely, just talking, thereÃ¢ € ™s nothing thereÃ¢ € ¦Me: why does she only call on the way to work then? No responseÃ¢ € ¦Me: Why has this never been mentioned to me? Ã¢ € œIt seemed like she was kinda looking for more and I thought you would be upsetÃ¢ € Ã¢ € ¦Me: heavy sarcasm no ****!! Why didnÃ¢ € ™t you put a stop to it if you thought she wanted more?...Ã¢ € well I knew there was nothing there for me, so I did not think it was a big deal to talk to herÃ¢ € . This situation had me in knotsÃ¢ € ¦I did not understand it when it happened and I do not understand it now. It made me feel vulnerable and insecure and I lost some confidence in the relationship and to be honest my guy. He thinks it was only an issue because I am insecure and lack confidence, that most women would not have been so upset. To me it was the first chink in the armor, to this point I was not having doubtsÃ¢ € ¦They continued to talk although less often and exchange occasional texts, even though they both knew how I felt about itÃ¢ € ¦Flash forward a couple monthsÃ¢ € ¦we are on vacation Ã¢ € œLisaÃ¢ €  seeÃ¢ € ™s pictures on facebookÃ¢ € ¦sends a text, which he shows meÃ¢ € ¦looks like you are having funÃ¢ € ¦if you love her(me), why havenÃ¢ € ™t you married her yet? He does not respondÃ¢ € ¦I am crushed(not that I was expecting him to say he was going to marry me, just somethingÃ¢ € ¦cause to me she was asking him a question, that question being should I just leave you alone and move on, and he left it open. I do not know if they are still talking occasionally or not.Scenario #2 Ã¢ € “ At a party outside, I am sitting in a chair he is standing behind me Ã¢ € œTinaÃ¢ €  is beside him, 4 different times I turn to look at him and she is rubbing her hands up and down his backsideÃ¢ € ¦neither of them know I am seeing thisÃ¢ € ¦I did not say anything then Ã¢ € œTinaÃ¢ €  is much bigger than I, had a few drinks and is known to be hot-headed. On the way home, Me: So I seen Ã¢ € œTinaÃ¢ €  rubbing you. Ã¢ € œYeah she was pretty drunkÃ¢ €  Me: Why didnÃ¢ € ™t you walk away? Ã¢ € œDidnÃ¢ € ™t seem like a big deal, a little drunk flirting is allÃ¢ €  Me: Really? Ã¢ € œWell if I had known you seen it, I would have done something about itÃ¢ €  Me: WTF, is that supposed to make it better?, What if I hadnÃ¢ € ™t been there at all? What if it had been someone besides Tina, that was more attractive and that you liked more(Tina is rather unpleasant in many aspects)? Ã¢ € œWhy are you always looking for something that isnÃ¢ € ™t there, itÃ¢ € ™s like you donÃ¢ € ™t trust me at all?Ã¢ € Obviously there was a lot more said, but this should give the general idea. To me both of these things should have been stopped by him, seems to me his lack of a response is a response (not to me, but to Tina and Lisa). If it were me I would be thinking well, he hasnÃ¢ € ™t told me to stop or walked away, or given me any reason to believe he doesnÃ¢ € ™t want me to keep on doing, whatever it is they are doingÃ¢ € ¦am off base on this? Does this just sound to you like I am being jealous and insecure, because that is what he thinksÃ¢ € ¦but these things truly hurt me, and I donÃ¢ € ™t feel like they are a result of me being insecure, but that I am insecure as a result of these instances. Do I need to lighten up? He really feels like he wasnÃ¢ € ™t doing anything wrong and he is not big on confrontation or hurting peopleÃ¢ € ™s feelingsÃ¢ € ¦but what about my feelings? What gives?

SOCL	Abnormal anatomy normal intercourse possible	Despite having had many incomplete (they didn't get the back) and painful pap smears over the years, a gynecologist has only now discovered that my wife has a vagina which is at a high angle to the Cerix so pap smears need special equipment and why intercourse in the few time we had it was uncomfortable at best.

FAML	My 4 year old is obsessed with pirates!	I need some advice.    I have a 4 year old boy who loves to play with pirates and skeletons.    It was cute and fun at first, but now it is getting to be too much and I fear that is all he is thinking about.    Most children I meet have a broad spectrum of what they enjoy but he is pretty stuck on this.    I've been reading books to him since he was born, when he was two I read a human body book and he was intregued by skeletons.    So I thought wow! my son must be    a doctor prodgey ( how dumb was I). So I think alot of this was my fault.    While I should have introduced many different things such as Tomas the Train, we were learning the human anatomy and crusing the halloween isles, because that was the only place they had skeletons.    While he learned alot of the atomical correct names, this fasination seems to have evolved to become gross.    I fear that the 2 years of this could have caused some mental damage because it was not age approprate.    So gradually I slowly threw alot of the halloween decor away and have been trying to introduce different things, but he is just not interested and seems to withdraw.    What should I do??    I had him in preschool last year, he made friends easily and was quite social.    His teacher said that all the pictures he drew were of skeletons.    She said that we was a good student and listened well.    Am I just being weird?    What can I do to help introduce things in an easier fashion?    Did I cause irreversible damage?        Please help....

FAML	Abnormal childr behavior	"Hi!I am asking regarding my cousin,she is 5 years old. I have also children 9 and 5 years but not any problem with them and can't understand if it's her behavior normal. This summer we spent one week together    holiday but never again. She is sometimes normal but very often she has like crises and she doesn't know what she is doing: screaming, looking on the top and her eyes are going around, taking cloths off, braking things(chairs and what ever). What ever parents says to her it is the same. They can't control her no with angry, no with nice words. Nothing! I tried    to ask her what she wants to do, why she is doing this. She doesn't answer, she looks at me but like she doesn't see me. I can repeat 3 times the question for example: Do you love your mum? She doesn't answer. Like she doesn't hear me or she doesn't understand. Even when she is ""normal"" she doesn't speak understandable, she doesn't understand that danger things (if she goes to road that car will hit her), she eat's everything what she see down on the street, in the toilet...Last year she had tuberkuloses.I tried to explain her mum that maybe she needs some help for this strange behavoir but nothing. What do you thing? Is that only bad behavior or something more.Best regards,hrikos"

DISE	Migraines and Vision?	"I was recently in a car accident (12/24/2010), and in the incident I never actually hit my head on anything but there was a lot of force against my neck and spine. I hit a cememnt wall from behind so the force was like a hucking motion in my seat. I really only suffered neck pain and some other joint issues. Then, two days later I had my first ever migraine with an aura and freaked out. I had the ""broken glass"" vision and the heat waves and the blind spots which passed followed by a massive headache. Ever since then, I sometimes get headaches but haven't had an aura like that yet reoccur. The headaches will be on one side of the brain and I know most of it is stress because I've been overly anxious since the accident. Since then, I've been also very observant of other things like floaters in my eyes and little white spots..like balls of light..pin dots really. I only see this in the sky or on white cars or my laptop's white screen but not in the dark or when I close my eyes. I pay a little ""too much"" attention to my floaters. I had my eyes dialated and inspected and was informed they were extremely healthy. I never went for a follow up or CT scan or anything from my main doctor. All my physical pain is gone..sometimes I get an upset stomach, mild headaches, etc..very tired.I've always had an anxiety issue. Before the car wreck my anixety was not an issue, I'd dealt with it but since the wreck it's returned to the surface in a way and I cannot tell if I'm so anxious I'm playing too much into my vision. Now my ears are rining and I feel a bit dizzy, but I've had tinnitus before and I don't get much sleep lately and I'm very stressed because of my anixety and mild depression. Is it possible to1) have these pin dots of light without a headache, in bright light? Or be sensitive to light without an actual migraine after a car accident?or2) through great anxiety and panic, see more pin dots of lightthese dots don't occur in the dark or anything and I'm not going blind or blurred vision so..they ruled out retinal detatchment. I had a load of xrays from the wreck and was deamed physically ok. Can you be so anxious you really play too much into what is just normal? As for the floaters, I've only had one or two new ones...but they may have always been and I'm not just observing them since the aur of migrain scared the heck out of me literally.I am wondering if migraines can be really ongoing in the background from stress and slight post trauma, causing this pin dot sensation, etc..or if it's more logical to say this is my anxiety. I frequently have a fear of death and over analyze my bodily sensastions..and when I'm distracted enough I do not observe these pin dots of light at all...or even my floaters...I don't know."

DISE	Throat Lump, Nasuea & Panic	Just before 3 weeks I had terrible sharp pain below chest    which was later followed by nausea and then feeling of lump in the throat    (swallowing trouble) and then panic jerks while sleeping. Suddenly my eyes are also staying dry and cannot read properly. My mornings use to start worse and at    nights I ended up better. Dr. prescribed me with Nexium 40mg per day along with some tests (glucose/LDL/Trigycerid were little abnormal). Before 3 days I did slow jogging for a mile and shockingly ever since then my throat problem has escalated along with severe nausea which now stays even at nights. I feel weak and sleepy but when I try to sleep it gives terrible panic jerks and wakes me up. On my 2nd visit Dr. visually checked my throat viewing inside the mouth and inspected by pressing the throat from outside and increased Nexium to twice a day and prescribed thyroid test whose results yet to come.(I had the same situation before 10 years, I had done biopsy/barium/endoscopy all came to be negative with just minor stomach inflamation(inflammation). I was depressed and    lost about 30 pounds. For 1 year they treated me with antacids, depression pills, consulation    for panic attacks with not much help until I moved to a different city and surprisingly all the symptoms disappeared completely.)Not sure if I have gerd or something else (sometimes I do feel stomach burning now), I feel terrible, depressed and cannot affort to stay like this too long again. I need to know if anyone has gone through this situation before and is there any cure or answer for this ?

TRMT	vaginal bleeding, very worried	Hi all,My friend who is 60 has experienced vaginal bleeding. She went to the doctor and the doctor who did a scan of the womb first of all said there is a thickening of the linking of the womb but that he doesn't think it's cancer (he showed her all the scan pictures too), but he has referred her for a D and C (she has to have a general). She is very over weight.Bit worried that he didn't think it was cancer yet has referred her for more tests. If he thought it wasn't then why would he refer her for more tests?Any ideas? If the doctor doesn't think it's cancer, are they normally right, do they normally have a good idea by looking at scans?Thank you in advance.

TRMT	Prometrium	I want to get some peopleÃ¢ € ™s opinions. This month I think my DH and I have finally gotten the deed done. But of course I am still waiting to be able to take a HPT. I am on Ã¢ € œ3dpoÃ¢ €  from my ovulation tracker but IÃ¢ € ™m 11 days from my first positive OPK (IÃ¢ € ™ve had 8 positive OPKÃ¢ € ™s in a row) and its day 33 on my cycle. Now, I canÃ¢ € ™t really say how regular I am because I have PCOS and I am normally on Clomid plus this is my third cycle since my m/c back in July and the first time for my DH and I to ttc. So I was thinking about taking my Prometrium. IÃ¢ € ™m thinking of doing this because; I believe IÃ¢ € ™ve m/c because of my progesterone levels were very low in the beginning and I was put on to Prometrium but I think I started it too late. And if IÃ¢ € ™m not pregnant then it will induce my period and I can start my first round of Clomid again. Does this sound feasible?
FAML	four year old behavior	"My son is 4 1/2 years old and is one of the sweetest boys you'll ever meet (most of the time)....However he can turn it off like a switch.    I want to be able to enjoy him the way I always dreamed of when I had children.    I find myself raising my voice more often than not...and yes, spanking his behind....moreso to get his attention....I realize that spanking to some, is not an effective solution. But sometimes I feel that it is the only way to stop him in his tracks.The last two days, he has ran off from me despite telling him to come back...or please stay away from the road, so you can be safe..etc....He looks at me with these devlish grin, and just keeps going.    It's all I can do to contain myself without screaming at the top of my lungs.    He does this running off thing quite often...and I don't know how to get it through to him that this is not appropriate behavior.    For instance, I got a hold of him yesterday, swatted his butt,and took him straight to his room......removed his TV...and explained to him why I was doing that..(you ran away, you could have been hurt..etc)......He says he understands....but the next day he does it again....and again....I feel like I'm consistent with discipline, but I feel that there has to be something else I can try.    Above all, I love my boys (3 year old also)0...and I HATE yelling....they certainly know how to push my buttons.My boys recently started daycare/preschool...and on Friday I got a report that My 4 year old was acting up.    I just want my kids to be respectful and productive members of society.......HELP?!?I'm just not satisfied that ""they will grow out of it""......I see a lot of    other kids that are their ages, who do not behave in these ways...I realize that it is behavior modification on the parents' part and the childs part...I need help...I would like to establish solid discipline before this becomes a huge problem...."
FAML	Step son is apathetic to school	I can COMPLETELY relate to the question previously asked. I have a 10 year old step son who is cute, charming, hilarious, but does not give a hoot about school. He lives with me and his father full time and sees his mother (when she is not working) every other weekend. I know he craves attention from her (something she does not quite understand after telling her continually) and I try to be the best supliment that I can, by helping him check over homework, doing projects with him, having dinner with just the 2 of us sometimes, etc,,,I have been in his life for over 3 years now (since 2nd grade) and when he started 3rd grade it all began - lying about homework, lying to get out of trouble, hiding important information from us... We take everything away and he does chores for weeks at a time while only being allowed to read for fun and as soon as the punishment is over, he continues to be dishonest (he is now in the 5th grade) and the cycle repeats itself. He truly doesn't find school to be a necessity - I'm pretty sure he looks at it as a way to pass time.The advice that the doctor gave to the previous question was to seek counseling as parents (for the father and mother), but what do you do when the mother is dishonest? She repeatedly tells stories (big planned out ones sometimes) and she is very vendictive - not out for the child's well being. If his father suggested counseling, she would probably turn it around to make him look like an unfit parent - which I can reassure you he is not. His father goes to the school regularly to talk to the teachers about his grades and behavior - they know him as the primarty parent, and he plays catch with him every chance he gets which is about 3-4 days a week.Is there anything we (me and his father) can do since we are with him most of the time? Are there any tricks that we haven't thought of?This discussion is related toApathetic Child.
DEMO	Risk of HIV	I have read a lot of the answers on the website, but I am absolutely paranoid about an hiv infection.    I was very drunk one night and had sex with a woman I don't know.    She gave me unprotected oral sex, then we used a condom for intercourse.    However, I believe the condom may have fallen off.    The next day I noticed a small scrape/cut on my penis.    The girl says she is healthy, but I can't be sure.    I am really stressed out by this and I know my chances are slim, but any reassurance would be appreciated.
GOAL	Any ideas on what could be wrong with my teeth?	I have braces on my teeth and have metal bands around 4 of my molars (1 in each quadrant) where the braces attach. On the two bottom molars, the teeth look kind of greyish instead of white. They sometimes hurt when I'm eating, but I don't know if that's just because they are moving with the braces etc. I don't see any holes in the top of the teeth, but with the band around them I can't see the sides of them to check for any holes. Does it sound like I have cavities in these teeth? Maybe a hole underneath the metal bands has let decay get into the teeth or something and that's why they don't look white anymore?

FAML	9yr old kid	My 9 yr old son has been developing an anger, emotional, and careless attitude.    It is not all the time, but most of the time.    He is very disrespectful, he is physically aggressive with his younger sibling, and has this I don't care attitude about school.    His school is considering having him evaluated for a learning disability because of his performance scores on academic test.    He blatantly told his teachers and I at a conference he just wasn't interested in the academic test and marked whatever answers he wanted.    We have had a change in our family structure. However I am not sure this is the problem,    maybe it's a power struggle?    I just don't know I'm at my wits end.    I've tried taking thing away as punishment for flunking every subject in school.    I've tried omitting sport activities.    I've even tried corporal punishment.    Nothing seems to work.    I'm considering bribery???!?!! (last resort)

FAML	Autism or Seizer Disorder?	I have an 18th month old daughter who has given me some concerns, and she has been late on some of her mile stones.    I have twin girls (fraternal) and they are very different, so it's hard not to compare.We are going to see a nuerologist (April 10th) for possible seizer disorder because she stares and zones out alot, and she has done this for a while, but within the last few months it seems worse to me and I'm taking action.    I wish I had taken a journal early on to really remember how she was at 9 months-12 months, but everyone was telling me she is fine, every child is different.She crawled at 11 months, and started really walking at 16 months.    She loves her books, I have read to both of my girls alot (and still do) since birth, and she especially likes to flip the pages (and early one, when Aleah did not)    but seems to look at the pictures as well.    Even though she turned pages early on, she didn't seem to have the grasping down at that time and only recently does she use her thumb and index finger (holding a stem of a flower, holding small puzzle pieces).She says da, da, ba, ba, ma, ma, but she doesn't say it to us to get our attention. She copies her sister alot, head shaking, banging a cup, clapping hands, but NO WORDS.    Most the time SHE DOES NOT RESPOND to her name being called, she would rather turn her head to a garbage truck coming down the street, or turn her head to an airplane way in the distance.If I say    we are going to have bath time, she knows and goes to the bathroom door.    She will be in the living room, and hear me say to her sister that I sippy cups ready, and she comes into the kitchen.    She started pointing at 16 months or so, and she is fascinated with airplanes, or anything that goes and started to point to the sky when she hears it, but no words.Her dexterity and motor skills seemed to be delayed, and she is a very happy child, she smiles ALOT, and loves it when I hold her (I stay home with my twins) but not so much with her daddy and I figured because I'm home more.She doesn't really do her puzzles, and plays (bangs them together) with them more them put them together (the wooden ones). She does do (when her sister is not around) her circles with the holes and put them on the wooden sticks (small ones even, her dexterity has gotten better).My concern is that some of her symptoms were autism (of some sort), or some type of delay, only did our pediatrician recommend a neurologist to rule out seizer disorder.    I also thought to have her hearing checked (even though she can hear an airplane from a mile away) and then maybe a referral to the mind institute at UCD.I appreciate your attention to this issue, as it is very important for me to do EVERYTHING and ANYTHING I can.    I have also (just for the hell of it) thought to do the no gluten no cassein diet.    Maybe I will try whole foods and see if I can find a book to help me with constructing a CF/GF diet.Kind Regards,Jennifer

SOCL	Right and Left Flank Pain	Hi there, I'm 16 and no one can seem to figure out what's wrong with me.About 4 weeks ago, I started having really bad abdominal pain (mainly my right flank, in between my ribs and hip). I also occasionally have it on my left side as well, but not nearly as often or severe. It feels like there is a lot of pressure on my organs and it's worse when I sit down and when I stand up suddenly.I went to a general physician and my urine came back positive for WBC. I was having a major operation the next day, so we got a CT scan just in case. It came back negative for kidney stones. I went back the next week and they took blood and urine samples again. The blood test showed that I had high glucose levels (because I had eaten within the past 4 hours) yet my kidneys were leaking ketones. The doctor put me on an antibiotic and gave me a pain reliever but my symptoms persisted. Then I started feeling fatigued and just overall crappy.I have been drinking a ton of water, but I have been urinating less frequently. So I went back a third time. This time, they tested for bacterial vaginosis, and it came back positive, but I'm nearly certain that this is not what's causing my pain, especially since I've probably had that infection for a while (being 16 and not sexually active, I don't normally have too many vaginal problems). I'm just in a ton of pain and want this to go away! If these antibiotics that I'm on now (round 4!) don't work within a week, I'm going to get an ultrasound from a specialist. Any ideas of what this could be? Thank you!

TRMT	Is taking 10000 mcg of Biotin safe?	I'm a victim of severe hair loss, which I believe is related to hypothyroidism, so I started taking Biotin. At first I only used 1000 mcg daily for a month, and the only difference I've noticed was the edges of my eyebrows were growing slightly. When I went to the store to buy more, the only dosage they had left was 10,000 mcg so I bought it. Being a sufferer of hypothyroidism (even though I have not been diagnosed, I know I have it), is it safe to take? Also, my mother would like to take them also and she takes high blood pressure and cholestorol meds daily.

SOCL	Bazinga! TV&#x27;s &#x27;Big Bang Theory&#x27; all abuzz over new bee	"(Reuters) - ""Big Bang Theory"" physicist Dr. Sheldon Cooper has a buzzy new claim to fame. The geeky TV character, who counts Britain's Stephen Hawking among his online friend, has had a species of bee named after his favorite catch phrase - Bazinga!Brazilian biologist Andre Nemesio said he named a species of Brazilian orchid bee 'Euglossa bazinga' in honor of ""the clever, funny, 'nerd' character Sheldon Cooper"" because the bee had tricked scientists for some time with its similarity to other species.Nemesio published his paper last month in Zootaxa, a journal for worldwide zoological taxonomists.Steven Molaro, one of the executive producers of ""The Big Bang Theory"" said on Wednesday that the CBS comedy was ""always extremely flattered when the science community embraces our show.""""Sheldon would be honored to know that Euglossa bazinga was inspired by him. In fact, after Ã¢ € ˜Mothra' and griffins, bees are his third-favorite flying creatures,"" Molaro said.""The Big Bang Theory"" - a comedy about a group of brilliant but socially awkward scientists - is one of the most popular comedies on U.S. television, attracting about 18 million viewers an episode.Actor Jim Parsons has won two Emmys for his lead performance as Cooper.SOURCE: http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/01/03/us-bigbangtheory-bee-idUSBRE90201720130103"
FAML	Stealing step daughter	I hope someone can help me ...I have been with my partner for the past 11 years, and married for the past 1.5 years.My 14yo step daughter (whom I have known since a young child) has been stealing items and money from her mother, father, myself and others (boarding students at her motherÃ¢ € ™s house) for almost a year now.    Her stealing has escalated over time to the point where 2 weeks ago she was caught using her motherÃ¢ € ™s credit card that she had apparently been using unbeknownst to anyone for quite some time now.    When she was found out, her mother slapped her in the face and kicked her out of her house.Over the past few months, I have approached and given her 'a talking to' on each occasion she had stolen my things (change and cosmetics), but her stealing seems to have escalated.    She seems a bit young in the head for her age, and maybe for this reason, my husband (in my opinion) does not dish out adequate discipline.    Even before I learned about the credit card incident, I had stopped trusting her and made it very clear that this was the case.After being kicked out of her mother's house, she arrived on our doorstep wanting to stay.My problem here is that I do not trust her anymore, and for this reason do not want her to stay at our house.    My husband does not care about what I think or feel about this and has insisted that she stay with us regardless.    This may sound like the responsible thing to do, but as I have lost trust in her, this situation is causing me so much stress it is now making me very angry, sick in the stomach, and interfering with my work.Because her mother hit her, the authorities are now involved and it looks like they want her to stay at our house away from the mother (I was never consulted). It looks like she's with us to stay indefinitely.As a stepparent I am/feel powerless over this whole saga.    I think this powerlessness and fear (of being stolen from) is contributing toward my anger, and I am now wondering if I have made a bad mistake marrying into this mess.    I saw a counsellor last week who suggested that we seek relationship counselling, but my husband just got angry when I mentioned this - insisting that he has no problem.    Trust is something very important to me, but when I tell him that I no longer trust her, he tells me 'to get over it' - as though regaining trust in someone is like getting over a cold or something.If anyone can offer any suggestions I'd appreciate the communication as I really don't know how much more of this I can take...Your thoughts are appreciated.
FAML	7yr old pinching and not listening	I have a 7yr old son in the 1st grade that has some behaviour problems.    He thinks pinching is like playing.    I've tried everything I can think of as far as discipline and it has been frustrating for me to find a solution.    I don't know how else show him and what else to say to get him to know that it is inappropriate.    When he was 3 I had to deal with the biting and pinching and when I took him to his pediatrician, he stated that he was probably not happy with his environment.    So ever since then he was put in a school with a smaller environment and he improved greatly.    Now I'm dealing with pinching and not listening since last year when he was in kindergarten.    I know I've been told that he is a boy and he is at that age, but I just don't want him to hurt anyone else and I don't want to hear anymore situations from the teachers or parents.    I am a single mother and I know It makes a difference if there is a male figure in his life but this is getting ridiculous.    He is also sometimes a monkey-see-monkey-do.    We all thought he would grow out of it, but I don't know it's still going on.    Please help, any suggestions is greatly appreciated and accepted. :O)

TRMT	Hernia (groin/thigh) question for my grandfather	"Hello, I have a question regarding hernias and the options available on behalf of my grandfather. He's been a huge part of my life and growing up (for my short 19 years) and after the loss of my grandmother due to what our family has come to as malpractice, I vowed never to let a family member or loved one go under the knife for any sort of procedure or operation without at least an ounce of understanding of what's happening. I don't mean to come off offensively to anyone in particular, I am only asking these questions (and follow-up questions for clarity) for the sake of my grandfather and deciding what the best recourse of action is.Currently my grandfather who is nearing 100 years of age has a hernia near his groin and has made 2 trips to the emergency room to massage it back in. He says that he ails in pain when the hernia pops out and is nearly immobile. Apparently after having a long talk with my father, he has had this problem for about a year and has been pushing it off to see what it leads to. (regular check-ups with doctors and all that) Well now that the hernia has popped out 2 times in the course of 2 weeks, the family as a whole is weighing the options and it is tipping in favor of the operation now as a last resort.So here are the questions that are on my mind. (go figure, it's 3:27AM and I have an examination at 8AM)1) What are the risks involved in operating?2) What options are there for operating? I read of camera-guided needles to opening a 4"" section to treat the hernia.3) What added risks or complications are there considering his age?4) What post-op risks are there5) What are steps to help with recovery?6) Are there any precautions to take prior to the procedure/operation? If so, what shall I ask of the doctor?Thank you for reading and I truly appreciate any insight or help you can provide."

SOCL	DowÃ¢Â€Â™s plunge could affect financial reform bill	"DowÃ¢ € ™s plunge could affect financial reform billBoth parties seek to capitalize on anxiety generated by historic dropSpecial ReportWASHINGTON - The stomach-churning fear about Wall Street's turbulence is roaring back.Europe's spreading debt crisis, fraud charges against Goldman Sachs and a 1,000 point nose dive in the Dow Jones industrials are turning up the heat on Congress to get the nation's financial house under control.If it continues, the stock market's dizzying plunge could threaten the fragile recovery even as other economic indicators Ã¢ € ” including the biggest monthly gain in employment in four years Ã¢ € ” suggest the U.S. is rebounding faster than its European trading partners.Investors appeared to be looking beyond the improving economic data to focus on vivid images of riots in Greece, floods in the South, the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the Times Square bombing attempt.There's already deep public hostility toward Wall Street institutions, so the Dow's extreme volatility seemed likely to work to the advantage of the backers of the Senate's financial regulation overhaul bill.The meltdown was cited by supporters as one more reason to tighten lightly regulated high-speed computerized trading practices. Both parties are angling to harness the anger toward Wall Street bailouts and bonuses for political gain in the fall elections.A robust stock market ""is key to the recovery. It's vital to keeping high-income households spending. It's key to business that have started to hire again,"" said Mark Zandi of Moody's Economy.com.""Business leaders are taking a signal from their stock price. If their stock prices fall, they're not going to hire. The recovery's going to be short circuited,"" said Zandi, a one-time adviser to GOP presidential nominee Sen. John McCain who now counsels congressional Democrats.""This volatility is not good for anybody and I think it's very important for someone to try to figure it out,"" he said.It didn't take long for politicians to jump into the fray.President Barack Obama said regulators were looking into Thursday's market panic ""with a concern for protecting investors and preventing this from happening again.""While the Senate legislation, an Obama priority, does not now address stock trading issues, attempts are under way to change that.Sens. Ted Kaufman, D-Del., and Mark Warner, D-Va., proposed requiring the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to scrutinize high-frequency trading and other computerized strategies that move buy and sell orders at blinding speeds Ã¢ € ” practices that may have contributed to Thursday's snowballing sell-off.Rep. Paul Kanjorski, D-Pa., scheduled a Tuesday hearing of the House Financial Services subcommittee that he leads. ""We cannot allow a technological error to spook the markets and cause panic,"" he said.Investors got an unmistakable reminder of how quickly their fortunes can change on Thursday when the Dow took a short but unprecedented 1,000-point tailspin. The sudden drop Ã¢ € ” generally believed to be due to trader error and computer glitches Ã¢ € ” sent the stocks of several companies briefly to almost zero.The Dow partially rebounded to finish the day down 347 points, or 3.2 percent. But turbulence continued on Friday, with the Dow falling nearly 280 points at one point before ending the day with a 140-point drop.The losses came despite Friday's strong U.S. jobs April report, approval by Greek lawmakers of drastic austerity cuts needed for international rescue loans worth $140 billion and approval of the package by both houses of the parliament in Germany, where bailing out Greece is unpopular.A Greek default could be dire. Greece's troubles already have dealt a blow to the euro and could result in far higher borrowing costs for other indebted European countries. The crisis eventually could cross the Atlantic to the United States, which is facing its own debt and borrowing problems that in some ways resemble Greece's.The U.S. stock sell-off, coupled with the government's civil fraud charges against the investment bank Goldman Sachs, should help build momentum for the regulation bill and hand Obama another legislative victory to follow health care overhaul, said American University political scientist James Thurber.""It sets even more of an environment to get the thing through,"" Thurber said. ""It triggers oversight hearings and concern about unregulated off-Wall Street trading institutions and computerized trading.""Stock trading increasingly has become dependent on computers that process trades automatically, speeding the flow of buy and sell orders, often on new electronic exchanges far removed from trading floors. What is known as high frequency trading Ã¢ € ” rapid automated buying and selling Ã¢ € ” now accounts for more than half of daily trading volume.It was not clear whether the market's jitters would calm with the release of more good economic news Ã¢ € ” or threaten to plunge the economy into a double-dip recession with a return of the rout that drove stocks down to bargain basement levels in 2008 and early 2009."

FAML	Extremely Angry 7 yr old boy	I have a 7 yr old son. He is extremely bright for his age and thinks and acts more mature than what he should at 7. In the last 3 years we have been dealing with a lot of anger issues with him. It doesn't take much to set him off. He have tried every way of discipline, from spankings (not hard or anything, just a tap on the rear) to sitting him down and calmly talking with him about the way that he feels. He doesn't respond to anything. He will get so angry that it brings him to lie about everything and he will raise his fist at us and kick at us. When we ask him to tell us what he is feeling and why he is so mad, he makes things up that doesn't make sense at all. We don't know what to do anymore. We are both at wits end and neither of us know how to handle him anymore. Lately, we have been discipling him by sending him to a time-out in his bed for about 20 minutes (depending on the extremity of the issue) and he will sit in his room and kick and punch the walls and scream at the top of his lungs. He isn't like this everyday but we have to fuss at him everyday for his behavior. He has punched his 2 yr old brother in the stomach before but is normally very nice to him and helps him out in any way. My son has gone back to my mother and told her horrible stories about my husband and I and I am very afraid that he will get taken away from us. What should we do and how should we handle this type of situation?
DEMO	Mosquito bite like bump on Labia majora. (Nervous reck, please help!)	I just realized that I have an tiny, itchy bump on my vagina.    It is located on my labia majora, under my pubic hair.    It isnt painful at all, but it is itchy. I dont think it is an ingrown hair because it is not painful.    It feels like a mosquito bite. What could this be? I am 22 years old and had sex for the first time about 3 months ago with my boyfriend of over a year.    I ruled out any sexual transmitted diseases because from what I know he doesnt have any, and if he did wouldn't sympotoms show after we had sex for the first time?    Also, if this helps, I just finished my period today and thats when I noticed the bump...and I just started using baby powder in my underwear, I don't know if that could have caused this.    Please help, I have a slight case of hypochondria, and I am worried I could have some kind of serious disease.    I know its probably nothing but someone please help!

DEMO	Unresolved Vaginitis for Two Years. Can anyone help?	Hi everyone. I am new to this forum and I was wondering if anyone can help me with a problem I have been having for the past two and a half years. I am 22 yrs old and I have Persistent Bacterial Vaginosis, with other things such as yeast infections and urinary tract infections from time to time. Lately, new symptoms are emerging that causes Pain around the anus. I wonder if the infection has spread.Doctors treated me with antibiotics, metrodidazole, diflucan, and hemroidal cream during the past. My UTI and yeast infection symptoms went away but the bacterial vaginosis persisted. I experience pain around the vulva every time I take a stride and sex can be painful.This all started when I was treated for my asthma with steroids such as prednisone, and lots of antibiotics.    I am also on a daily steroid-based inhaler.    I wonder if the medications had messed up my body somehow, and if I had lost the good bacteria to fight off the antigens in my vagina. And if it is, is it reversible?I see the doctor at least once every two months because the symptoms always come back. I am clean, and I've tried everything I can think of from wearing cotton underwear and loose clothing everyday to eating yogurt daily. If anyone has any other suggestions, can you please let me know or refer me to someone who can help? I would really appreciate it. Thank you =)This discussion is related toPersistent Bacterial Vaginosis.

FAML	my 15 yr old is jelous of her unborn sibbling	For 6 years my daughter has been asking for a baby sister. Well, after 5 years of trying and tons of heart break we have achieved this. I am now 18 weeks pregnant and found out 2 days ago it is indeed a girl. Since then my daughter has been very distant and uninterested in anything to do w/ the baby. Yesterday I went out and bought a bunch of stuff for the baby and when I got home I was all excited and showing my kids (I have a 14 yr old son as well) when my daughter told me all I care about is the baby. I could not believe what I was hearing. I had to realy push to get her to tell me what was going on. Then she broke down crying and told me she is afraid her stepdad won't love her anymore because now he will have a real daughter. (My husband has been the only father she has ever known and her bio dad is no where in the picture.) I told her that was not true and that his love for her would never change. She said we were replacing her w/ the baby and that he would no longer have time for her. I explained that baby's do take alot of time and attention, but that we were hoping she would be there to help as well. I explained we want her very involved and that her relationship w/ this baby was going to be very important. Being 15 years older and the big sis, Trinity (the baby) would probly be coming to her for things she doesn't feel she can come to us about. She just told me she wasn't going to be around. She was sobbing and I could tell she was very upset. She's 15 and I never thought we would have this issue at this age. I don't know what else to say to convience her that we will always love her very much and nothing will ever take that away. I asked my husband to talk to her, but I'm not even sure if that will help since I couldn't get through to her. Does anyone have any sugestions what we can do????
TRMT	Nerve damage after hysterectomy?	I had a hysterectomy with removal of both tubes and ovaries 7 months ago.    It was done laparoscopically/vaginally.    2 weeks postop I hemorrhaged due to a pelvic hematoma and was rehospitalized.    That pain was incredible.    Since then, I have had shooting pain down the low back, buttocks and down both legs; sometimes causing my right leg to buckle.    At times, the pain will shoot up into my right side and arm even with stretching or leaning forward.    I saw a neurologist who has started me on gabapentin which helps somewhat, but doesn't find or fix the cause.    As well, in my research on gabapentin, I see a possible link to pancreatic cancer and am quite startled as I am an 11-year breast cancer survivor.    Any thoughts on the cause of this nerve pain considering the length of the time it has remained?

Is it MY RIGHT to have this surgery or is it TOTALLY up to the doctors and insurance?????????????

I don't want to have to go back for something in the future.Also, what are the REAL DOWN SIDES from your experiences of having a hysterectomy?    I would LOVE to hear from women who have been through this.    I have talked with women a little that live near me and they all say IT'S AWESOME and THEY'D DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN.    Some had partial, one a full and one I ""think"" was radical.    I thought a full hysterectomy was everything, but I was wrong.......    LOLHoping to get some answers SOON as my appointment with the oncologist is the DAY AFTER TOMORROW...............    YICKS.............THANK YOU ALL...........IN ADVANCE.    :-)"
DEMO	Extra Period after Two Days on Birth Control	Hi!    I just started taking birth control (loestrin24fe) on Sunday and continued on Monday and then quit because this just wasn't a good time for me to be taking a pill every day.    So I only took two pills and then Thursday night my period started.    I had actually just had my normal period the week before.    This one is much lighter than usual.    I didn't think just two pills would mess my cycle up.However, I'm going out of town next weekend (7 days from now) and I really really really don't want to be on my period then.    Will this period last that long?    My normal period is only 5 days long.    My period was only like a week ago so could there have been that much build up of blood in that time?My other question is if I start taking the pills again today, will that help stop this other period?    I would stay on them this time as I plan to start using them in the near future.    I just don't want to do anything to prolong it, not sure if starting the pills again might do that.    Thanks for any advice!

FAML	4 yr old potty issues	Hi,We are struggling to get our almost 4.5 yr old potty trained and to go on his own. He goes pee in the potty with reminders and will go on his own about half the time or tell us he needs to go. The other times he has accidents which is when he is busy or occupied so is understandable.Now he won't go poop in the potty at all. He knows he is going I think, as he does it right in front of us and doesn't seem to care. We ask him if he is doing something and needs to go to the bathroom and he saids he is not doing nothing and gets quiet while he is going in his pants and then runs and laughs and makes it a power struggle to get him changed. We ask him to go in the bathroom and clean up and he simply refuses and runs and hides and makes it very frustrating. Sometimes when he goes pee and he has pooped, he goes pee and pulls his dirty underwear back up. I don't know if he knows or if he doesn't care he has dirty pants.We have stopped used pull ups during the day awhile back, and he goes to pre-school and daycare and in the past 2-3 weeks both have asked he wear pull ups at preschool and daycare until he poops in the potty on his own.We have tried everything with him and nothing is getting to him. We have tried reward charts, stickers, special prizes, etc. We got him some bigger prizes for when he goes poop on his own and he wants them but they sit on the shelf un opened still.We have brought this concern up to his pediatrician and he saids it is normal behavior and he'll get it eventually. We are concerned and frustrated as if he doesn't get this figured out soon he won't be able to go to kindergarden, etc.We are concerned of his behavior while he is doing it and not caring and then running away. How do we stop that?    We have tried taking toys away for this behavior, etc and again nothing seems to have an effect.
GOAL	Eye Sinking	I just saw a post where a 16 yr old is talking about there eye sinking in. Mine is doing the same thing and I'm 30 yrs old. It started about a month ago and I can see a noticeable difference from one eye to the next. I too went to the eye Dr. and he told me he could find nothing wrong with my vision. I can feel it in my nasal cavity when I touch my eye sometimes. I get the pains behind my eye, under it and in my eyebrow. My vision gets blurred and it's very uncomfortable when someone is standing up and I'm trying to look at them while sitting down. I found something called enophthalmos and silent sinus syndrome. Could this be what is wrong?

TRMT	Stitches still strong after 13 weeks	I had a total LAH along with a rectocele and perineal body repair. It's been over 3 months and my stitches at the top of the perineum (bottom of vaginal opening) are still there and very strong. Because of this, my husband and I cannot resume sex yet. (Did try once and my poor DH got cut!    ) I don't think that they are long enough for a doctor to grasp and a thin layer of skin may have healed over the stitches. I've heard of stitches not dissolving even after 11/2 years! Is that true? If the doctor can't get a hold of them to remove them and they won't dissolve on their own, is there anything I can put on them to help them along? I'm having trouble with my insurance company paying for the surgery and surgeon is out of state. Therefore, I cannot afford to go to the gyn unless I know beforehand that there is something that can be done. Any advice?
PREG	IVF and Regulating THyroid	I had my thyroid radiated several years ago and I am on Synthroid. My current dose is 137, 5 and 1/2 pills a week. I just had my third failed IVF cycle(I did achieve pregnancy in Dec. and miscarried at 7 weeks). The problem is my thyroid is under 2 at the beginning of the cycle and 6 weeks later was 3.54. I know the birth control pill does interfere with the thyroid levels. So how do I keep my thyroid in range while I am on the BCP, Lupron, Menopur and Gonal-F. So, how do I figure out how much to increase the dose of Synthroid while I am on these meds?
FAML	Underwear statement	I am male and born 1944,I stopped wearing u/w 1951 aged 7 I absolutely hated underwear.I really don't care if you are male or female,or your kids are b/g please take note of how they feel if they feel more comfortable without wearing underwear let them dress that way.Any parent who has concerns over dress codes obviously loves their kids.A parent that found out that I didn't wear underwear was at first disgusted about it,and when her daughter tried it and liked the idea (about 8) mum flew off the deep end so to speak.She started going crook at me over it (I was 14).I told her to try it before you condemn it.That took some time to sink in, but in the long run the whole family (5) got into the no undie club.Mum decided that the two boys didn't need any and the three girls only wore short half slips under school clothesand didn't have to wear anything under shorts,long pants (jeans) or long skirts.John the Aussie blokeThis discussion is related to4 YRD OLD WON'T WEAR UNDERWEAR.

Every minute of every day, he is so mean to me and his sister. His baby sister and i have to lock ourselves in a room at times because he is spitting and kicking. He thinks it is funny to hurt us. This isn't new. He has been this way since he learned how to talk. He is very emotionally disturbed, i know. But this behavior only is with me and others he lives with. i have tried to sit with him and give him more and more attention. he, out of the blue, kicks his baby sister in the head and laughs. he has a therapist, a docter, and med reviews. He is on resperdal, which doesn't make it any better. He has tried other meds that make it worst, or don't work. His psychologist says he has anger issues with me. I don't know why. these behaviors aren't ""when he is mad"". they come out of nowhere. i am scared of him. today, he thought he would wake me up by sitting on a pillow on top of my face. I don't let him watch scary movies, I am a stay at home mom. is he truely sadistic? He says he is going to pee on me. He won't go to his rm when i tell him time-out time. We used PECS pictures because of verbal delays. But i seem to think he is just thinking it is fun to be meant to us, no matter what. Please, help.

SOCL	Iran behind alleged terrorist plot, U.S. says	http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/iranian-charged-in-terror-plot/2011/10/11/gIQAiaYxcL_story.htmlU.S. officials on Tuesday said that they had foiled an elaborate terrorist plot backed by factions of the Iranian government aimed at assassinating the Saudi ambassador to Washington.At a news conference, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said two Iranians have been charged with conspiracy to murder a foreign official and conspiracy to commit an act of international terrorism, among other charges. One of the suspects, an Iranian with U.S. citizenship, was arrested in New York last month; the other, an Iranian, remains at large.188CommentsWeigh InCorrections?inShare.GalleryÃ¢ € ‰The Justice Department accused elements of the Iranian government of being involved in a plot to assassinate Adel A. al-Jubeir, Saudi ArabiaÃ¢ € ™s ambassador to the United States.VideoTwo people have been charged with conspiracy to kill the Saudi ambassador to the U.S. A federal criminal complaint filed in New York says the two conspired to use a weapon of mass destruction and have ties to Iran. (Oct. 11)More on this StoryDocument: Terror charges against Manssor and ShakuriDocument: Justice department press release on the alleged plotRead more national security storiesMore headlines from around the worldView all Items in this Story.Ã¢ € œThe United States is committed to holding Iran accountable for its actionsÃ¢ €  and would take Ã¢ € œfurther actionÃ¢ €  against Iran later Tuesday, Holder said.The suspects were identified as Manssor Arbabsiar, a 56-year-old from Texas, and Gholam Shakuri, an Iran-based member of IranÃ¢ € ™s Quds Force, an elite division of that countryÃ¢ € ™s Revolutionary Guard Corps responsible for foreign operations.In addition to killing the Saudi ambassador, Adel al-Jubeir, officials said, the plot envisioned later striking other targets. The officials said that the plan to kill the ambassador was directed by Tehran, and that Arbabsiar has acknowledged that he was recruited and funded by men he understood to be senior officers in the Quds Force.Shortly after the announcement, the Iranian government denied the accusations, calling them a new round of Ã¢ € œAmerican propaganda,Ã¢ €  according to state news agency IRNA.Ã¢ € œThe U.S. government and the CIA have very good experience in making up film scripts,Ã¢ €  Ali Akbar Javanfekr, a spokesman for Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, said in Tehran. Ã¢ € œIt appears that this new scenario is for diverting the U.S. public opinion from internal crises.Ã¢ € Officials described the details of the plot as chilling, saying that the conspirators considered blowing up a restaurant frequented by the ambassador.According to a criminal complaint unsealed Tuesday, Arbabsiar met with a DEA informant Ã¢ € ” who was posing as a representative of a Mexican drug cartel Ã¢ € ” to arrange the killing. At one point, the complaint says, Arbabsiar told the informant that he would need four men to carry out the ambassadorÃ¢ € ™s murder and that he would pay $1.5 million for the operation.As a down payment, Arbabsiar allegedly later arranged for $100,000 to be wired to an account that was secretly overseen by the FBI.Ã¢ € œThough it reads like the pages of a Hollywood script, the impact would have been very real and many lives would have been lost,Ã¢ €  said FBI Director Robert Mueller.A spokesman for the National Security Council said President Obama had been briefed on the case in June.The United States has listed Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism since 1984. The government in Tehran has long denied accusations that it backs terrorism.Iran and Saudi Arabia are bitter political enemies in a long-running Middle Eastern conflict fueled largely by sectarian rivalries. Saudi Arabia, a monarchy with a predominantly Sunni Muslim population, has felt threatened by the Shiite leadership of Iran ever since the 1979 revolution toppled Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and replaced him with a theocratic government.Jubeir, 49, is one of the best-known Saudi figures in the West and among the most powerful foreign policymakers outside the royal family. The son of a Saudi diplomat, he speaks fluent German and virtually unaccented American English. A political science and economic graduate from the University of North Texas, he also holds a masterÃ¢ € ™s degree in international relations from Georgetown University.He first appeared as a spokesman for the Saudi government during the 1991 Persian Gulf war, and quickly became known as a foreign policy adviser to then-Crown Prince Abdullah, with particular influence on policy toward the United States. When it became known that the Sept. 11, 2001, al-Qaeda attacks were carried out by Saudi citizens, Jubeir was dispatched to Washington to represent the kingdomÃ¢ € ™s interests before the American public and policymakers. He became ambassador the the United States in early 2007.His extensive contacts within the administration and among lawmakers, policy experts and journalists Ã¢ € ” and his closeness to the most senior figures of the Saudi government Ã¢ € ” have helped Jubeir has worked to strengthen U.S.-Saudi ties.
GOAL	severe blepharoconjunctivitis in right eye  (picture)	After i was injected triamcinolone acetonide in one chalazion in my upper eyelid a year and a half ago, infection spread to my lower eyelid and conjunctiva. Since then I have been using several antibiotics with little help: ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, monofloxacin, fusicid acid, chlortetracycline... Also anti-inflamatory drugs like Tobradex and FML which help reduce inflamation(inflammation)but not treat the cause.What worries me now is that inflamation(inflammation)has reached near the cornea, as an incomplete bluish ring.

SOCL	Reading Glasses	I am 44 years old and recently had cataract surgery in my right eye.    The lense is a monofocal and set for distance. In my left eye I have a +2.5 contact lense that I wear that helps me see for both distance and close up. Without the contact in my left eye my vision is best about 15 inches out.    I spend a lot of time on the computer and reading for work purposes and would love to be able to wear reading glasses so I don't have just one eye reading all the time.    I asked my surgeon about getting reading glasses and he advised that I would probably not be happy with them due to the differences between the two eyes. His nurse suggested I buy some glasses at the dollar store and pop out one of the lenses to see how my vision was. She was correct. They gave me a sense of double vision. Why is that?    Any alternative suggestions for me?

SOCL	Pigeons	"A friend and I feed a flock of city pigeons every day (Rock Doves), at about the same time,along with a flock of sparrows. There are nineteen pigeons in the group and nine sparrows.The sparrows delight in swiping bits of bread from the rock doves a second before they reach it!Nevertheless, the rock doves don't attack them, but seem to take it good naturedly.The sparrows and the pigeons have become quite friendly, and we have given names to the pigeons, all of whom have different personalities. They will eat out of one's hand and will hop on a table and try to get into the bag where we bring a muffin or bread. They love bits of hot dog.The most dominent pigeon is ""Big Debbie"", who fluffs up, chases the other birds away, seems to want all the attention and all the food.One of the more interestihg observations is the fact one sparrow (an adult) had an injured leg and the other sparrows pick up bread bits, carry it over to this adult and feed it.I am surpised at the comments we get. People really seem to hate these birds."

SOCL	Mother in law visiting	Kind of interesting.    My mother in law passed away a while back.    The other night, I cannot remember what kind of day I had, but when I went to bed, I clearly smelled cigarette smoke.    Mom was a smoker, but nobody in the house smokes.... I don't think anyone in the neighborhood smokes for that matter, and besides that, we all live on 2 acre lots, so it would take someone smoking in the house or right outside the window to created that smell.Also, the same night I kept seeing shadow figures.    Quite a few of them, and not just in the house either.    At work, in the gym.    I'm not scared by them and don't pick up any bad energy or anything.

PREG	prometrium question	I need to know if anyone has had a successful pregnancy using a progesterone supplement after a pregnancy has already occured.    I have read that it should be started after ovulation for it to be effective.    I was seeing an ARNP who specializes in fertility, then got pregnant and had a m/c and was seen by a doctor.    I called her nurse today hoping to get a progesterone level drawn based on my + LH surge and she told me the doctor does not check progesterone until after I am sure I am pregnant.    I am wondering if I should go back to the ARNP, but would like to know if prog. supplemention after a pregnancy has started is effective.Thanks, this is a really great site and I will appreciate any insite I can get.    I just don't want to miss any chance of a healthy pregnancy.    Another m/c would be devastating for me!
SOCL	Do you have one person that controls money in your relationship?	I work with a man that is constantly talking of not having money because his wife manages their budget.    He is allowed to have $20.00 per week in cash, but has to account for each and every dollar spent.It's Friday and normally, a lady in my office and I go grab a burger or something and visit - on Fridays.    It's usually no more than $5.00-$6.00.    He's new and we have invited him to lunch on a few occasions and as long as we paid - he would go.    He just told us that he has the money to go but his wife didn't TELL him he could use his $5.00 today.    I asked him if he didn't have a debit card and he said, Yes, but I am not allowed to use it.     He was actually counting change to see if he could get an order of fries when she and I went!Granted he was out of work for a couple of months, but we just found out that (he told us) that he received 6 months salary when he was laid off.    This isn't someone making $6.50 an hour - I do the payroll and know what he makes and it's definitely not a nominal amount.    He has also mentioned that he doesn't have any large bills - 1 car payment - small house payment (under $700 a month) - his mother buys his family their clothes - his wife works....    nothing unusual (OH and NO credit cards)....why he shard that is beyond me....I understand the need to save money,especially in today's economy, but he is always talking of savings, etc. and now he mentions that he isn't ALLOWED to spend money, as little as $5.00.    I have read all of the Dave Ramsey, and I get it....but even Dave Ramsey allows for SOME use of cash.    I just can't imagine being a 41 year old - professional person - who isn't allowed to spend $5.00!Is that a normal (and as I told him - if it works, good for you), way to handle finances in a relationship?    My husband and I budget, but we have an amount that we are comfortable to spend without accounting to each other - at least for lunch once a week.What is your opinion?

PREG	irregular shaped gestational sac	Hi! We've just got our first baby's first doppler ultrasound at 7 weeks of pregnancy. The doctor said the baby has a good heart beat and the size is fine for the gestational age. However, she told me we have an irregular shaped gestational sac that might cause some risk to the child. Said pregnant women usually have a spherical sac, and mine isn't. Any mom here who have had the same experience as mine. Might go back for another ultrasound after a week to see if there has been any changes with the shape. Help, Moms! Help!

DEMO	Am I pregnant or just wishful thinking?	Ok so basically I had the Mirena insterted in September of 2011, after having months of cramping and bleeding I had it checked and sure enough it had moved. After an attempt to find it with an ultrasound I was scheduled to have it surgically removed. Well, 3 days after appointment was booked I felt the strings. My doc checked and sure enough there they were and she grabbed it and removed it. This was on the 12th of December 2011. The week prior I had a pregnancy test just to make sure and it was negative. Well my husband and I only get to see each other every couple of months so of course we have plenty of intercourse during our time together. From the 17th of Dec 2011 to the 26th of DEC 2011 We had intercourse once every day if not twice, and we werent careful. One or two of those days I noticed the tell tale sign of ovulation, you know that pinch and cramping. On the 27th of DEC I woke up nauseated and lasted for a few hours. during the day i noticed I just felt off and weird...headache all day, moodyness, heart palpitations, really thick milky white discharge (more than usual) with no odor and some cramping/bloated feeling. 28th woke up again nauseated and with a headache, heart palpitations, discharge, tender nipples, dizzy/light headed feeling,a little congested. Woke up 29 DEC and felt normal other than of course heart palpitations, discharge and all the rest except nausea...ok so i go about my day. Later on that day I get nauseated all over again. I have yet to get my period maybe its just me hoping, but im thinking its way too soon to conceive. Well the morning of the 29th of DEC I got an HCG Qual done at the clinic I work at and it was negative. Is it too soon to tell or is it even possible to conceive immediately after removal of the mirena. Please help me im so confused and I have no one to talk to being that my husband is over 13 hours away from me. HELP!!

SOCL	State of the union address....	"http://www.whitehouse.gov/state-of-the-union-2012Did anyone watch the State of the Union Address last night?    What did you think of it?Personally, I agreed with a lot of what the President had to say.    Yes, there were some philosophical difference, but nothing really sent me reeling until I heard the statement... ""No bailouts... no hand outs.... (and I think he added ""no excuses"")""    To me, it seemed like he was almost trying to say that the bailouts of the auto industry and the banking establishment were bad ideas.    He didn't come right out and say it, but he did say that ""we (the American tax payer) are not going to do that ever again"".As for the part that was along the lines of ""no excuses""... my mind rushed straight to the talk of the bail outs and stimulus package ""might not be enough"".Hand outs?    Solyndra....Pretty much everything else was okay, but as I mentioned some philosophical differences that were expected."

I was diagnosed with genital warts. So I got the Aldara cream and just after 2 applications 1 of the warts (I have 3) is completely gone and the other 2 are almost gone. One of the 2 that are remaining was supposedly the biggest according to the doctor and she said it would take weeks for it to go away. She said I can stop using the cream when there are no visible warts. My questions are:1) I've read/heard that Aldara is very potent but does it really work this fast? It's just been 2 days (I apply it every other day-3 times a week-as prescribed).2) Also I was told not to shave b/c the warts can spread but does that mean in the area where the warts are (near the vaginal opening-no hair there) or in the general vicinity (as in nowhere down there)?3) I'm supposed to get my period this week. Should I use tampons or pads?4) Is it okay to wear thongs?I leave for vacation tomorrow and it would be nice to not think about this (and to shave). Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.

PREG	Question about my FSH, LH levels	I was wondering if anyone here has levels of FSH and LH like I do. I did some blood work at my doctors office mid cycle, almost eactly mid cycle and here were the results:Estradiol: 478 pg/mlEstrogens: Total 558 pg/mlFSH: 0.7 L (mlu/ml)LH: 4.9 mlu/mlProgesterone: 1.8 ng/mlTestosterone: 87 ng (slightly high)I have extremely painfull periods and have been unable to concieve(conceive)for a couple years. I haven't really seen a specialist about it yet, but I was just wondering if anyone could shed some light as to what some of my test results show. I have very regular periods, but they are Very heavy and painful. I also have hair loss on my head, and excessive bodily hair. I've had an ultrasound done of my uterus and three small cycts were found on my left ovary and one on my right. My doctor said everyone has some and it's probably not the reason for my slightly high testosterone. Just looking for anyone who knows what might be going on. I am 27, weight 125 pounds and have been out of work for a while due to very low energy.This discussion is related toFSH and LH levels at midcycle peak.
GOAL	Progressive extreme myopia	Hi,I have been wearing glasses since I was around 7 years old(started with -3D). The problem is that even though I have grown up now(I will turn 27 this November), the myopia hasn't stopped from progressing. Today I wear -13D in both eyes and the last time I had to change my glasses was in the March of this year as the power increased from -11.5D to -13D. I am again getting the feeling that I am not able to see clearly from my right eye. The point worth mentioning is that I have such feeling only when I put my contact lens(-12D in both eyes) on and with glasses(-13D) on, I don't have any such feeling. I wonder why this is happening to me when I have got a new pair of contact lenses as per the prescription from my eye specialist. I am really worried abt the future and wonder when would the eye-sight stabilise. I have also noticed that whenever I do some physical labour (like running on treadmill or cycling), it seem to be causing my eye sight to deteriorate. Please could someone suggest if there is really a relation between physical labour and weakening eyesight.My eye specialist did not allow me to go for lasik laser surgery saying that she could see some retinal changes in my eye and it would not be advisable to go for surgery in near future. Any thoughts on that....Thanks in advance.Kakaatoo!

FAML	my 3 yr old squeezes or picks on his face whe not ocupied	my son picks on his face (it used to be around his finger nails before) when he has nothing to do ie. in the car or at night when Im reading a book.    I noticed some anxiety when he does it.    he gets a few tiny pimples from it that go away he next day.    once or twice he has picked on a cut that he created.    If I give him 'a lot' of attention and affection he relaxes and stops. by 'a lot' I mean if I hug him through out the day 'a lot' and treat him like a little baby then he starts saying gugu gaga and he is happy.    why?    I have 2 toddlers and I dont have enough free time to do that, what can i do?
GOAL	Headache and it's relationship to Eye pain	"As a result of what has been termed ""coin headaches""( these apparently are headaches that are specifically located on an area of the scalp about the size of a silver dollar), I am experiencing sharp spontaneous pain behind my left eye. This pain subsides quickly; however I am very concerned that it will    cause physiological damage to my vision. I    had an MRI last year which showed nothing negative and a recent visit to my optometrist also indicated nothing unusual.

TRMT	granulosa cell tumor	Hello, I am a 52 year old female and    I recently had surgery to remove granulosa cell tumor on my ovary. Tumor was totally encapsulated with no leakage.

FAML	5 year old in trouble every day in kindergarten	"My 5 year old son has been getting ""sad faces"" every day in kindergarten.    There are always multiple comments from his teacher, mostly with regard to not working when others are working, talking in the bathroom, crawling around on the floor, and not walking ""nicely"" in line.    He can be very obstinant at home. It seems as everything is met with defiance (""I don't want to....""). He tends to grunt or stomp when asked to do something.    Even though he has learned his sight words and performs well academically, he always voices that he doesn't want to learn...that he would rather play.    He can read all of his sight words but will read with an exasperated voice.    All he wants to do is play!    As with many other 5 year old boys, he is very self centered, does not like to share, HATES to lose at anything.    He has a 2 year old brother and they are typical in terms of getting along one minute and fighting the next. I feel like he has changed since his brother was born.    His brother is almost 3 now! Should we not be seeing some changes.    My husband and I take away privileges, spank when deemed appropriate, and send him to his room for time outs.    We set up a reward system and that worked for about 2 weeks but he returned to acting out behavior in school.    When in preschool his last year before kindergarted he often got reports of being ""disobedient"" by the teachers (this was a Christian Academy).    When asked why he acts out he will often reply, ""Because I wantede to"" or ""I thought about it doing it and I did it."" I am at my wit's end.    Naturally, my thoughts go to ADD or Oppositional Defiant Disorder.    I feel guilty because I am beginning to dislike my child.    Please help!"
TRMT	Possible medical error on Pentacel	My son received Pentacel vaccine at 6 month check up.it was third Pentacel Ã‚  for him. however I received call from nurse saying that he may not received the hib portion because nurse maybe forgot to mix the hib powder. They are not sure if nurse really forgot to mix it or not. Pediatrician said my son received diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis and poliomyelitis portion but not sure about hib portion.he recommend my son to come get hib in 4weeks when he will be 7month old. I am concerning the risk of getting extra hib in case he was actually received the hib portion because the extra dose he will get will be dose number 4 hib. I was reading CDC web and they recommend to have minimum of 8 weeks interval between hib dose 3 and 4.it said minimum recommended age for hib dose Ã‚  4 is 12-15 month. Is it ok for my son to get the Hib in 4 weeks when he is 7month old? When should my son get next pentacel dose?Here is the link I saw about interval of hib...http://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/downloads/appendices/a/age-interval-table.pdf

FAML	Freaked out 9 year old	"I have a 9 year old girl that used to be an amazing sleeper and never had any type of fear issues.    We live in a 3 girl house of Disney Princesses and Family Channel without any ""scary"" stuff at all.    A month ago we had a friend sleep over and during the sleepover, they told each other Scary Stories.    Well, since that time, my 9 year old and my 6 year old will not sleep alone, go into the basement alone, go to the bathroom alone, or go anywhere alone.    They are joined at the hip.    I think the 6 year old is mostly milking it, however my 9 year old is in a panic and will start crying hysterically and lying so she does not have to be alone.    Pre scary story, the 9 year old has rarely cried and has always been very neutral, now, she gets almost hysterical if we make her shower alone.    We have tried splitting up the 2 of them and making them sleep alone, we have tried splitting them up and sleeping with them, nothing seems to work!    We have tried talking about the story, we have tried Rainbows, Bubble Gum and Unicorns...Ideas, suggestions, help of any kind is appreciated"
DISE	Collapsed Lung Problems Need Advice from expert	Just a bit of background Information. I was 15, and a pretty hardcore lifter. I lifted weights 6 days a week, used professional bodybuilder workout plans. 4-5 workouts per body part, and I hit them pretty heavy. I had a 3-4 % body fat and was extremely fit for my age. It all came with a cost, I was at a local gym and my lung collapsed during chest training. Doctor told me to wait a month, then continue with lifting. I did as they said. Everything was fine...then 4 months later it hits again. This time the doctors are concerned on why my lungs aren't healing correctly. Ive been out of lifting for 4 months now, and am no longer physically active. One doctor recommended surgery, other said it was too risky. I have not had any pressure or pain of the lungs in about 3-4 weeks. I really want to get back into lifting and being as physically fit as possible. How can I do this?
DISE	Assessment 4 Ultrasound RT Breast	I had a mammogram and ultrasound due to a mass I found in my right breast a few weeks ago.    I am 46 years old.    The ultrasound report stated that I had a possible fibroadenoma and that it was a circumscribed hypoechoic mass.    The ultrasound says that I am an assessment 4 at the bottom of the report.    I will be seeing a surgeon soon because the radiologist recommended I have a biopsy.    From what I read it is very unusual for someone my age to have a fibroadenoma.    I have not had a period in almost 2 years and have NOT taken any hormones.    What is an assessment 4?    Any comments are welcome.
TRMT	Regretting my hysterectomy decision because of health problems I can't handle.	I had my hyterectomy last year when I was 48. It was performed due to the fact my lining was cancerous but in the early stage. I can't take homones therefore. I noticed my anxiety and depression is so bad and also after having blood work done last week my cholesterol is high at 279. I never had high cholesterol before. Am I experiencing all of these problems because of the hyster. I feel like I made a mistake in having the surgery. What am I suppose to do now to gain my life back.
SOCL	Lightheadness and possible anxiety	A couple of weeks ago I developed this strong lightheadedness and had a really odd feeling in my body; I think it might have been anxiety.    My blood pressure also goes up during this time    (example:    145/93 - pulse:    89)    I have this off and on all day.    Usually goes away at bedtime.My primary care doctor has taken blood tests and an EKG to rule out any other problems; so far the tests are normal. My doctor is not sure what the problem is.... doesn't sound like she knows how to advise me at this point.    The lightheadness is really a drain on me and makes it difficult to concentrate.I have been under stress for some time.... as I have been unemployed for well over a year.    My question is, can anxiety come on so suddenly..... I have had stressful situations before, but never experienced physical symptoms.    I am also a middle-age woman....at menopause. What can I do beside medicate myself to relief these symptoms so I can feel normal again? And if I have to take anti-anxiety meds.... what are the safest?

TRMT	X-rays with Barium	Hello!The expertforum doesn't work, that's why I ask here.I had a    X-raytest with Barium. Doctor said to wait 30 min and that then somebody did a photo of my stomach. But a nurse calles me in 20 min and did the photo. Yes, I am fool, that I didn't objekt to this, but it is to late for this. So, in general, the doctor come to the conclusion on the grounds of the foto, that the Bariumpassage is retarded from the stomach to the duodenum and through the duodenum. Could it be a diagnosis because of untaking,that the foto was done    not in 30 min, but in 20? And could you assess    with help of this foto the Bariumpassage from the stomach to and through the duodenum?Thank you and sorry for my english

SOCL	Ear/Sinus Issue or TMJ?...Please respond!	I went to the doctor 2 months ago over my ears bothering me.    Mostly they were just a bit achy but I would get an occasional pain down in my ear/jaw pain, and even eye pain when chewing.    My doctor said I had a lot of fluid behind my ears and that my right eardrum looked really dull.    He assumed my issues were also being cause by a sinus infection as I had some throat irritation as well.I took antibiotics for 2 weeks and I'm still having problems.    Haven't went back to the doctor about this yet.    My left ear bothers me some but mainly my troubles are on the right side.    I keep getting this tingling feeling back in my right ear and I sometime feel like I have fluid in my ear.    Also have some achiness in front of my ear at what I believe is my jaw and there seems to be a small knot there - when it's bothering me the pain goes up to my temple and sometimes behind my right eye.    When I wake up in the morning usually that's when it feel the best, but by the end of the day even my face aches.    Also, in the afternoon, I can't even get a q-tip in either ear - it's not like that in the morning.    Any idea what could be going on?

FAML	My eight year son is misbehaving	My eight year old son appears to most as a highly intelligent, beautiful and caring young boy. But then he goes to school and he turns into a monster (according to his teachers). Over the past several weeks, his behaviour has progressively deteriorated - he has started hurting the other children, pushing them over and hitting them (boys and girls). The teacher has disciplined him every time and he spends most of the day outside the principles office. The school is now threatening to suspend him.He has started seeing the school councillor to work through his issues (what ever they may be!). But when you ask him what he did, he has a very different account of what happened, saying it was only a fun punch or he didn't yell in class, he was only calling out the answers.We have tried dipscipling him at home for this behaviour- removing his favourite toys, but this only inflames the situation because he thinks there is nothing more that can be taken away from him, so why should he be good?When he doesn't get his own way at home - he back chats and has to have the last word and can also be very cheeky (his answers are always highly intelligent). He threatens to throw things, but never actually does - he just wants to scare you.Nothing has changed at home for this behaviour to become evident and he says he likes his teacher and the school -Does anyone else have similar issues with their kids? I see other parents with their children and wish mine could be more like that....I'm at breaking point.

DISE	What Do We Do Next?	"My 16 year old daughter needs a diagnosis. At the age of    9 she had a severe kidney infection that required I.V. antibiotics, (her fever got up to 105.1). At 12 she had a UTI. At thirteen she had several UTI's and was sent to a urologist. She was told her urine was clean and that if she had one more to come back. Several months went by with no problems. At 14, in a matter of hours she developed another UTI that included vomitting and fever. Just a few months after that she got another one, a few months later she began getting the symptoms of a UTI with urine tests and cultures coming back negative. We took her to another urologist who began to treat her for IC. After about a month on an antihistimine she had an ""attack"" of pain in her back, in the area of her kidneys. Sometimes both sides, sometimes one more than the other. During one of these severe episodes that occured after hours I was told by another doctor in the same practice that he had never heard of a 16 year old with IC, and that the pain in her back didn't make any sense because both sides were hurting. We then    met with the head doctor in the same practice who insinuated that she was maybe looking for attention. From there we went to a pediatriac urologist. The nurse practioner sent her for a sonogram and a VCUG. We were told to make sure the VCUG was done with cycling, that she was sure she had VUR, that even with the cycling it would be hard to detect. The sonogram looked great. The VCUG was not done with the cycling due to a lab error. But we were reassured that the test looked perfectly normal and that they didn't think she could have VUR. During all of this my daughter had developed severe fatigue. At first we thought it was the antibiotics she was taking. A high dose of Macrodantin followed by a preventive dose. That was changed to Bactrim with a little improvement.The urologist said he saw nothing wrong with her and suggested she see an Immunologist. We are baffeled. She has spuratic bouts of burning during and after urination, and pain in her kidneys, and the fatigue is still there. She is about to start her cheerleading season and won't be able to with all of this going on. She says her muscles feel very weak. Please help me figure out what to do next. Another urologist? An Immunologist? Any help you can give us?"
DEMO	Perineum cuts? PLEASE HELP ASAP.	My boyfriend & I have been having sex for 4 days straight. He is quite large and we usually have very rough sex. On the first day my vagina was fine but on the second day after intercourse my vagina started hurting. When I use the bathroom (peeing) it would hurt and burn. The next day after intercourse my vagina hurted even more that I couldn't even have sex. I looked at myself and I saw a very small cut by my perineum and one at the very beginning of my vagina. When I pee it would hurt and when I wiped there would be a little blood. It also bothers me throughout the day. Does this sound like a perineum cut, or can it be something else? And if it is, is there anything to help cure it?
SOCL	Why are they soft	Why are members of the secular media soft on Muslims but merciless on Christians ,The answer is simpler than you think its cowardice,fear of swift Islamic retribution and retaliation has kept the secular media in the West hiding in their proverbial 'foxholes' Fear is a very powerful    fact of life ,attacking Christians has become fashionable ,you need only to read the BBCs website on any given    day ,you will find countless examples of condemnation of Chistians around the Globe .It is safer to pick on Christians,after all the essence of their faith is Love , forgiveness and peacemaking.They would never respond in the same fashion to their Muslim counterparts .The secular media has come to realise that their accusations will not be challenged since the tenants of the Christian faith are to love our enemies and bless our persecutors .

TRMT	Abdominal Abscess due to e coli	My daughter had her appendix out. They tried lap surgery and ended up performing the open surgery. She was in the hospital for 4 days throwing up and unable to eat the whole time but they released her. She was home less than 2 days when she stopped by my house and I noticed how red her surgical site was as well as swollen. I took her straight back to the er. They opened it partially and placed the packing in. She has been on heavy doses of iv antibiotics as well as daily packing changes for 7 days now. It is finally starting to look much better but she still has the nausea.    She has lost approx 20lbs in the 11 days.    Just this morning the dr was talking about sending her home possibly with a iv in for antibiotics to continue as well as having a home health provider change the packing daily.    My concern is how can they even consider releasing her when she can't eat. The smell of food causes he to get sick.    How will she tolerate packing changes on only oral meds when she can keep anything in her stomach?Is there anyone with experience with this abcess(abscess)/packing process?

I was doing Follistim sub-q, but had no response.    My question is does anyone have pain while injecting?    Not the needle so much as when the liquid is injected, I can barely stand it!!!    Me and DH have watched the instructional videos over and over so we know we're doing it right.    I called the RE this morning and they said they've never had that complaint before about Bravelle.    The sensation of it going into the muscle is just... unbearable.    And it lingers on a bit for almost 20 minutes afterward.I was wondering if anyone else has the same reaction.    I know Bravelle isn't oil based like Progesterone so it shouldn't be painful like this.    DH thought maybe he isn't getting all the air out of the needle before injecting.    Anyone else have that happen with painful effects?
SOCL	Genetic Testing	I've posted this quite a few times in the Genetics and Cancer forums... with zero (0) responses. So, I'm asking this question, here, with the hope that someone can offer me some insights.This question is for anyone who has knowledge and/ or experience regarding genetic testing (counseling). My recent mammogram returned with benign findings... However, due to extensive family history of Cancer, including Breast and Ovarian Cancer; and, given my own history of developing abnormal yet non-cancerous growths in my breast, the radiologistÃ¢ € ™s recommendation was for me to undergo genetic testing. On the other hand, my lifelong family physician questions the value of this approach, Ã¢ € œÃ¢ € ¦ knowing that [I] will not be having children.Ã¢ €  IÃ¢ € ™m somewhat inclined to agree with my doctor... and forgo testing. However, my mother (whose two sisters died of Breast Cancer) is pushing for it... and, my sister, who is an Ovarian Cancer survivor also feels that I should go for it. Before I make a decision as to which way to go with this, IÃ¢ € ™d like to know the insights and opinions (pros and cons) of anyone who has had... or know of anyone who has had... genetic testing.Thank you in advance.
SOCL	Marfans and Bronchomalacia	My daughter is 10    months old and has been diagnosed with Marfans Syndome along with bronchomalacia.

FAML	risperdal ??????	I have a 5.8 year old who we have been taking to a therapist for behavior management.He was born at 32 weeks has had late developmental milestones..severe speech delay, walking, feeding etc.. he has done very well with early intervention and specialized pre school however around 4 behavior became severe,,outbursts and DEFIANCE.. he is dx ADHD and ODD and I have put off meds for as long as possible.. He is extremely bossy, whines and basically has meltdowns all the time if he does not get his way.. He will NOT listen most of the time.. His tantrums get worse and worse.. We tried Focalin XR 5mg and we saw basically no results.. The Psychiatrist now suggested Risperdal .2 mg(very low) 2x per day..I read everything I can find on the drug.The Dr. says it is now being used for mood disorders.. He is calling it Mood dysfunction or something.. He is not bipolar,..He just seems to go from zero to meltdown over any little thing.. it gets exhausting and I see how this is effecting everyone in his life.. I see how people don't want to be around him because it gets too tense with all the meltdowns.. I am worried about the risperdal.. is this a good tx.?? he has only been on for about 9 days.. and i do see some improvement.. I am just worried we are using a med that is really for other illnesses... will this target the fact that my son has no self control and is impulsive in actions and words??
FAML	Sexual curiosity	My 5 yr old son and the neighbor boy, 6 yrs old, were caught touching each other inappropriately.    Mouth to penis and penis to penis.    Two different times.    The first time the mom's handled it the way we thought best.    The second time my husband was included and our children are no longer ever allowed to see each other.    This ends our friendship.    How do you know when it goes beyond natural curiosity?    The other mom has voiced concern in the past that she thought something had happened to her son.

PREG	Indiscriminate soiling	my granddaughter aged 3 is fully toilet trained but has started soiling indiscriminately in her toyroom.

SOCL	William Ayers Controversy	"William AyersDuring the 2008 presidential campaign, reports surfaced that then-candidate Barack Obama knew and had had limited interactions with fellow Chicagoan William Ayers, a former member of the Weather Underground group, which in the 1970s had bombed several government buildings. Right-wing bloggers and Fox News' Sean Hannity seized on the story, embellishing Obama's contacts with Ayers in order to paint him as a ""radical."" Obama's ""relationship"" with Ayers eventually reached a national audience during one of the Democratic debates. It wasn't until months later that the media documented Obama's largely tangential links to Ayers, debunking the right-wing myth.Right-wing bloggers attack Obama-Ayers links. Conservative bloggers seized on two media reports to attack Obama's links to Ayers. On February 15, 2008, Bloomberg News reported that ""Obama could face questions about his relationship with William Ayers,"" noting that Ayers ""donated $200 in 2001 to Obama's Illinois state Senate campaign and served with him from 1999 to 2002 on the nine-member board of the Woods Fund."" On February 22, 2008, Politico's Ben Smith reported that in ""1995, State Senator Alice Palmer introduced her chosen successor, Barack Obama, to a few of the district's influential liberals at the home of two well known figures on the local left: William Ayers and Bernardine Dohrn.""Based on these articles, right-wing bloggers began attacking and distorting Ayers' links to Obama:* Commentary's John Podhoretz: ""But here's a thought experiment. What if John McCain had visited the Unabomber's cabin? Or had been photographed with Terry Nichols? Or had stopped off at David Duke's house at some point because he was gathering support and donors?"" [""Obama's Ayers,"" 2/22/08]* Stop the ACLU: ""Obama does some nice double talk and condemns the actions of the Weather Underground, however he remains good friends with two of them that remain unrepentant for their actions."" [""Obama's Terrorist Friends,"" 2/23/08]* Right Wing Nut House: ""I am talking about the extent of the candidate's ties to domestic terrorists from the 1960's and how the American people might feel about their future president paling [sic] around with someone who set off bombs as a member of the group Weather Underground and to this day refuses to apologize for it."" [""Obama and the Radicals: Soulmates?"" 2/23/08]* Human Events' John Batchelor: ""Will the four horsemen of Mr. Obama's November, Rezko, Ayers, Rashidi and Auchi, lead to a similar defeat for the spectacular candidacy of Barack Obama?"" [""The Obama Files,"" 2/25/08]Hannity picks up Ayers story. Hannity seized on the Ayers story soon after, and mentioned Obama's links to Ayers on an almost daily basis for weeks afterward.From the February 27, 2008, edition of Fox News' Hannity & Colmes:HANNITY: Bob Beckel, I want to ask you about William Ayers. If you recall, he admitted that he was involved in the bombings of New York City police headquarters in 1970, the Capitol building in 1971, the Pentagon in 1972. We have a report out today, ABC News via the New York Sun that he donated to the Obama campaign. We have a report out, that Obama visited his home as, quote, ""a rite of passage when launching his political career in the mid-1990s."" His spokesman -- Barack Obama -- said, ""Yes, they're friendly. They know each other."" Does the presidential candidate for the Democratic Party have any business being friendly with and potentially accepting donations from a man that admits that he blew up and helped plan and set a bomb at our Pentagon?From the February 28, 2008, edition of Hannity & Colmes:HANNITY: There is the issue of this guy from the Weather Underground, this guy Bill Ayers. This is a guy that admits to being part of the bombing with the Weather Underground of the New York City police headquarters in 1970, our Capitol building in 1971, the Pentagon in 1972. And it was reported by Jonah Goldberg, who will be here tomorrow night, that as a right of passage, Barack Obama visited him when launching his political career in the 1990s.When asked about it this week of whether or not they had a friendship, Barack Obama's spokesperson admitted that, in fact, they were -- that they did have a friendly relationship. This is a guy who is admitting to bombing our Pentagon, and was part of a group that declared war on the United States. I'm sitting here thinking as an outsider, if I'm Hillary Clinton, that's a big issue for the American people in a post-9/11 world.From the March 9, 2008, edition of Hannity's America:HANNITY: William Ayers is a guy that was with the Weather Underground, a group that admitted to bombing our Pentagon, bombing our Capitol Building, bombing New York City police headquarters, said as recently as 2001 he regrets he didn't go further. A group that declared war against the United States.Barack Obama met with him when he started his political career in the 1990s and he also went on to say about William Ayers that he is friendly with him. You look into that camera and you tell me why a presidential candidate should get away with being friends with an admitted terrorist.Hannity complains about lack of media coverage. Soon after he began flogging the story, Hannity began attacking the media for ignoring it.From the April 9, 2008, edition of Hannity & Colmes:HANNITY: Well, the philosophy -- because they declared war against the United States. And the philosophy was -- the Weathermen philosophy was kill all the rich people. Ayers summed -- these are Ayers' words: ""Kill all the rich people. Break up their cars and apartments. Bring the revolution home. Kill your parents. That's where it's really at."" And he's unrepentant.KARL ROVE: Right, well, and they attacked -- they attacked, as I recall, police facilities, military facilities, U.S. government buildings. And they did so in a manner without apparent regard for human life.HANNITY: Yes.ROVE: I mean, I think -- I don't recall that people were killed or injured, but that was not the -- that wasn't the intention. They wanted to create violence and blow things up.HANNITY: Karl, I first interviewed Jeremiah Wright in March of 2007. And I stayed on the issue. And it took almost a year for the mainstream media to pick up on the story, and it became a big story. Do you believe at some point somebody in the mainstream media is going to examine this relationship that Barack Obama's campaign claims is friendly?From the April 15, 2008, edition of Hannity & Colmes:HANNITY: But Doug Schoen, this is the problem. A new narrative has emerged. And it is Michelle Obama's comments. It's these comments in San Francisco. It's the unrepentant terrorist, Bill Ayers. We've been covering on this program. The mainstream media has ignored it. It's him attending the Million Man March. Why did he attend the Million Man March?Stephanopoulos talks to Hannity, asks Obama about Ayers. On the April 15, 2008, edition of his nationally syndicated radio program, Hannity interviewed ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, who was set to co-moderate the Democratic presidential debate the following day. During that interview, Hannity suggested to Stephanopoulos that he ask Obama about his ""association with Bill Ayers, the unrepentant terrorist from the Weather Underground."" Hannity continued:HANNITY: When asked about it by the Politico, [Obama campaign chief strategist] David Axelrod said they have a friendly relationship and that they had done a number of speeches together and that they sat on a board together. Is that a question you might ask?Stephanopoulos responded to Hannity: ""Well, I'm taking notes right now."""
FAML	bad behavior linked to enlarged lymph nodes?	My four year old has enlarged lymph nodes and is acting completely out of control (screaming, being rude to strangers, saying she hates everyone, etc).    The doctor can find nothing wrong with her other than the enlarged lymph nodes (in her neck).    He says it is probably some kind of virus.    She occasionally complains of ear aches but then will say they do not hurt anymore.    Can her behavior be linked to the lymph nodes?
FAML	5 year old is upset about erections	My 5 year old son is very upset when his penis become erect. When asked if it hurts, he says no. When he is busy playing outside or watching a favorite cartoon, he doesn't display this behavior. Sometimes, he does use this as a way to get attention from my husband and I. We've tried ignoring the behavior and trying to distract him, but it is troubling that he is so upset by it. Unfortunately, he pulls on the penis and hits it to try to get the erection to go away, which makes the problem worse, of course. We've explained that this is supposed to happen and that it happens to all boys. He doesn't attend daycare and spends his time with his 4 1/2 year old brother and his stay-at-home Dad, so we know that he hasn't observed this behavior in other kids. I am hoping for some advice about how to help my son become less concerned about this. Thank you.

It appears to be based on autoimmune disease or disorder (hypersensativity to infections) that result in cns/demylenating disorder/disease.I started with overload of infections and lead to cns/demylenating disorder - see neuro    on Tues -hopefully has some answers although last time i saw him (6 months ago)    I    was not aware of cns/neuro involvement and my son recently started with infection battle (when he was younger had gone through 15 ear infectionns and found out he had neuro immune deficiency.It seems odd that all three of us are following a very simular path. Cousins on my father's side have also battled the overload of infections.Our paternal grandmother had poliarteritis nodosa, however I have been told that you can tell just by looking at a person whether they have this or not because of the effects on the skin. She passed away at 51.Would reallly appreciate anybody's input or anything simular to this type of    family linked illness based on infections sensativity followed by cns/neuro implications.sinceerelymixedblessings

SOCL	Police seek couple who fled, leaving dead toddler behindBy the CNN Wire Staff	"(CNN) -- Arrest warrants have been issued for a southern California couple who may have fled to Mexico after authorities found a dead child in their home, a police spokeswoman told CNN Tuesday.The Bakersfield Police Department found a 3-year-old girl dead and a 4-year-old boy sleeping in the home Sunday morning after responding to a call from the children's aunt.Police want to question Alberto Garcia, 26, and Carla Garcia, 26, about the child's death and check on the well-being of three other children believed to be accompanying them.""We believe they are in a border town,"" said Sgt. Mary DeGeare with the Bakersfield Police Department.Police said the Garcias were trying to adopt the young children, who were the natural children of Carla Garcia's sister.Police have issued murder and felony child endangerment warrants and are still working on obtaining an unlawful flight warrant through the FBI, DeGeare said.""We want to take them into custody for the murder, but we are more concerned with the children's welfare,"" she added.The three children believed to still be with the couple have been identified as Carlos Joe Solvalvarro, 9; Crystal Garcia, 5; and Alberto Garcia Jr., 4. Police corrected earlier statements made to CNN that Carlos Joe Solvalvarro, who is Carla Garcia's child with another man, was 10.Carlos Solvalvarro, the younger Solvalvarro's father, is worried about the safety of his son while he's with his mother and stepfather. Solvalvarro told CNN affiliate KBAK that he's had tiffs with the stepfather in the past and his ex-wife is short-tempered.""The father just likes to pick on smaller people than him,"" Solvalvarro told KBAK.The family drives a white 1997 Ford Expedition. Bakersfield police ask anyone with information about the family's whereabouts to call them at 661-327-7111."

DISE	long term neuro problem?	"A number of years ago, approx. 1988, I developed what the hand surgeon, I believe referred to as a neurofibroma.    This was in my wrist.    Only a few months before, I took a hormone coctail in preparation for invitro fertilization.    The physician took photos of my wrist at the time of surgery.    The nerve resembled a big earth worm that had swollowed several peas.    The growths could not be removed, as they were part of it.    The physician cut the sheath around my wrist to make room for the growths. Although he said that it could not be determined, I believe that the invitro triggered the fibroma.Also, beginning around the same time, but I don't believe to be related, I started having random experiences of tingling of my face and sometimes hands, and had trouble with vertigo? not sure if that is the correct term...a feeling like I was trying to walk on a rocky boat, especially after exiting an elevator.I had a test performed where they shot cold water in my ears.    I tested positive for something.    I can't remember what they called it, but I became very dizzy.    The neurologist said that if I wanted that he would get more agressive in tests to determine the cause, but I opted to just wait and see how I did.Over the years, I have continued to have varying degrees of the symptoms above. (not the neurofibroma).    But, recently, the tingling has worsend.    I have tingling in my face, arms, hands, and feet.    I also have numbness in a portion of my back. I get the feeling that I am ""going away""    This is my terminology of course.    I don't feel like I blacking out, or going to faint.    It is more of a feeling like I am going to have a seizure or something.I did have a seizure approximately 2002, but I didn't know it was coming.    So, I don't really know exactly why I am describing the feeling that way.    I think it is more from seeing what happens to a person who is having a seizure.    I feel like they look.    Does that make any sense?The tingling comes in ""waves.""    I feel okay, then the tinglings well up, almost like a hot flash.I know that you can't diagnose me from this description, but can you point me in a direction?I don't have a photo of my neurofibroma, but supposedly it was published."

FAML	Middle child	"I recently attended parent/teacher conferences for my 5 year old daughter.    Her teacher told me that she is concerned about my daughter as she is not interested in playing with the other children.    I was told that during play time, she doesn't really engage herself in any particular activity, but seems to be in ""her own world.""    When at home, she plays with her older and younger sister (she is the middle child), with her dad and I, and plays easily alone with her toys.    Even though she initiates play at home, I now look back and remember times where I have picked her up from Sunday school or another activity, and noticed her alone in the classroom instead of interacting with others.    When I asked her why she doesn't play with the toys or kids at school, she just says she doesn't want to and doesn't like any of the toys.    She is also very resistant to do activities that the others are doing, or is the last one to finish or finally participate!    I'm not sure what to think or do!    Her teacher said that she seems like a ""typical middle child"" and that she ""needs purpose!"" I was crushed to hear this!    I spend time with all of my children and try to give them as much individual attention as I can, but obviously I'm lacking as a mom and feel like a failure!!!Does anyone have any insight or advice on this?    How can I help my daughter??!!    Thank you!"

FAML	11 year old cries while participating in sporting events	We have an 11 year old boy that is wonderful!    He is very intelligent, has a great group of friends, and does well in sporting activities.    However, over the past year until now, he will cry when he doesn't do well at a sporting event.    Even if he makes 10 baskets in a row at a game, then misses the next one, he will start to cry.    He also does this on the baseball field.    We have tried everything and do not put any pressure on him, it is the pressure he puts on himself to be perfect.    He does not act like this in school or anywhere else, just on the playing field.    Any suggestions as to what we can do to help him control these emotions? Thanks!
TRMT	A Critical Overview of Homeopathy	Homeopathy has been a blessing for me. I really get a smile on my face when I see physicians dismiss what has helped me so much. As someone who couldn't tolerate allergy injections, I decided to find a practitioner who could help me and I had success with homeopathy. I suggest people and especially physicians try it for themselves and/or do more research on this medicine that is over 200 years old and obviously survived for a reason. I'm sure this is why Prince Charles and the Queen of England both swear by homeopathic treatment.Anyhow, here is a great article on homeopathy that was published in the Annals of Internal Medicine:A Critical Overview of Homeopathyhttp://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/138/5/393

PREG	Sharp pain on left side at 11 weeks	Hello everyone!    I am having a sharp pain on my lower left side.    It comes and goes, but it is pretty strong.    Any ideas?    I called the doctor and we wants me to come in.    I am 11w 1d and have had many ultra sounds, so I know its not eptopic.    It is probably just ligiment pain, but I was worried enough to call.    I was suppose to see the doctor on Wednesday for my 4 weeks check up, so I am just going a couple of days early.    Do you think they will be able to hear the heartbeat with the doppler today??

DISE	1st post	First time posting but I've been lurking for months. Read a topic today encouraging us (me) who have been behind the curtain to come out. Here I am!I've been abusing oxycodone for a little over 2 years. Started as a weekend thing, and as you can guess, turned into a daily thing. Many things have brought me to this point, but I'm ready to just stop. Been using 60-160 mg daily. Just depended on $$ and time.I've tried to stop many times, but only half hearted about it. Now that I'm posting, I personally know I'm ready to move on with my life!Right now, just looking for encouragement!Thank you
DEMO	My baby sweats in a grobag but will not sleep in a sheet and blanket please help	I really hope someone can help advise me. My daughter is 3 months old and has sweated in 1.5 tog grbags several times. I had put her to bed in a short sleeved vest and cotton babygro and room temp 18 degrees.I had previously tried 2.5 tog but much worse sweating on back under arm area. The grobags say 100 percent cotton and have been to doctors about it and touch wood they say she has no symptoms of any disorders associated with babies sweating to be on safe side have been referred to hospital and have appointment next week. My instinct tells me it is the grobag as only happens when she has been in it.My other daughter had grobags so never experienced this before. I am aware of all the horror stories and last night tried cellular blanket doubled over and sheet doubled over but she was cold on chest and we were up all night. One extreme to another it seems I must admit I worry a lot and am no doubt over anxcous but am making myself ill as can't sop worrying and stressing over this dread every night as so scared of her being too hot or cold. Please if anyone can advise I would be very grateful. Thank you. Just to add her cot bed has an anti sweat sprung mattress and I was thinking of having heating on for half an hour intervals 1-1:30 and 3-3:30 and then again at half 5 wheras last night just had it on at 3 and 5 does this sound right or ok? Know I must sound so over anxcous just read so many horror stories making me paranoid10 hours ago - 4 days left to answer.Additional DetailsLast night she was restless by 3am (went to bed at 11:45pm) and even when I got her back to sleep and placed her in her cot bed so gently, as soon as I tucked the sheet and blanket over her she was restless and would not settle as you can imagine I am so tired and am dreading every night time. My husband wondered about if we were to cut a hole out of the back of her 1.5 tog grobag so as to allow air to circulate where her back was getting hot but I am just so scared to do anything that might be unsafe. Hope someone can help me with this.
DISE	Getting through this	I am currently 27 hours in to my detox and I really thought that it might be worse than this. So far I have major chills, sweats, anxiety, skin crawling, insomnia. But that is really the worst parts. Will it get worse than this and when will I start to feel better? I have taking 3-4 10/325 hydrocodone every day for almost a year. I came clean to my fiance this weekend after our pre-marital counseling session (we are getting married in June and it is required by our officiant) He is being 100% supportive and standing by me through this. He knows of my history with addiction and has zero judgement. So, will the withdrawal symptoms get worse from here. Not sure what to expect from the dosage I was taking. Any advice would be great!

Then I got this ""bug"".It looks like this: It starts with lackof appetite (unusual foe me!) and then chills, and diarhoea..and after that, I feel drained, with more chills, and an achey(achy)neck.It hasn't been too bad so far, only two bouts right before my Tx was over, and a couple bouts since it ended 2 weeks ago. I really dont want to do the whole stool sample thing yet, so I am treating it with probiotics, and other natural remedies.I noticed nobody ever mentioned using Pepto Bismo for stomach upset, during Tx, but I think I may try it now, as it has worked well for me in the past.Has anybody else experienced this type of bug post Tx,and if so, how did youtreat it?    My eosinophils were at zero last week, on my EOT labs, so I am freaked out thatit may be intestinal parasites :o ~~~~~~~~~~"

SOCL	Today they start rescuing the miners in Chile!	"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39625809/ns/world_news-americas/#10/12/10COPIAPO, Chile Ã¢ € ” Fresh air and freedom were just hours away on Tuesday for 33 miners trapped a half-mile underground for 69 days, men whose endurance and unity have captivated the world. No one in the history of mining has been trapped so long and survived.""This story started as a tragedy and we hope that in a few hours, it'll end in a miracle,"" Chilean President Sebastian Pinera said to reporters gathered at the mine site.Video: Watch live video of rescue operation (on this page)Pinera said hopes were the rescue would begin at about 5 p.m. Eastern time.""I hope that family members, before the day is over, start to hug their fathers, brothers, sons,"" he said.Follow breakingnews.com for the latest updatesPinera told the mother of 31-year-old Florencio Avalos that he'll be the first of 33 men to be rescued from the collapsed mine.His mother, Maria Silva, says he's not surprised he was chosen and that she's very proud of him. Avalos is a married father of two children and one of the mining crew bosses..""We made a promise to never surrender, and we kept it,"" Pinera said, shortly before two rescue workers were expected to go down to prepare the miners for their trip. The president said the first miner will be brought up about two hours later.Chile has taken extensive precautions to ensure the miners' health and privacy, sending down Navy special forces paramedics to prepare them for the trip and using a screen to block the top of the shaft from more than 1,000 journalists at the scene.Nervous anticipation grew among the miners' relatives and friends as Mining Minister Laurence Golborne earlier said rescuers aimed to start hoisting the miners in a custom-made escape capsule on Tuesday evening, hours ahead of schedule.Panic attacks feared during miner rescue..The men have spent 69 days in the hot, humid bowels of a gold and copper mine in Chile's northern Atacama desert after an Aug. 5 collapse, and now face a harrowingly claustrophobic journey to the surface in specially-made capsules.Asked about the biggest technical problem that could hit the rescue operation, coordinator Andre Sougarett said: ""A rock could fall.""""There is no need to try to start guessing what could go wrong. We have done that job,"" a confident Golborne said. ""We have hundreds of different contingencies.""Rescuers were keeping the miners busy on final preparations they were to climb into the capsule for what tests indicated should be a smooth ride to the outside world.The rescue of all the miners is expected to take about 48 hours, NBC News reported, with crews working around the clock. It will take approximately one hour for each miner to reach the surface Ã¢ € ” a few minutes to situate a miner in the capsule, 10-15 minutes travel time upward, and then 25-30 minutes to drop the escape cage down the shaft again.As the miners emerge, they will be sheltered from the glare of TV cameras. They will get an immediate medical check and gather with a few family members in an area closed to the news media. Officials say a siren will sound as each miner emerges.Then, they will ride in helicopters Ã¢ € ” two at a time if they are in beds, or four at a time if they can sit up Ã¢ € ” to the regional hospital in Copiapo for a battery of physical and psychological exams.""Our job is to provide benefit and not harm,"" Manalich said, urging the media Ã¢ € ” more than 1,000 journalists are working on the story Ã¢ € ” to respect their privacy. ""We have to protect them until the last minute, until they can return to normal lives with their families.""Wives, children, parents and friends are waiting on an arid, rocky hillside around 2,050 feet directly above them at a tent settlement dubbed ""Camp Hope"" and ready to celebrate..""Right now I'm calm, though still very anxious. I hope my nerves don't betray me when the rescue starts,"" said Jessica Salgado, whose husband Alex is trapped below.President Piniera, who ordered a revamp of mine safety regulations in the wake of the accident, arrived at the mine on Tuesday afternoon in anticipation of the rescue. One of the miners is a Bolivian national and Bolivian President Evo Morales has also vowed to visit the mine for his rescue.'Camp Hope'While the men endured their darkened days below, life at ""Camp Hope"" has turned into a spawning ground of intrigue, envy and rivalries that have divided the miners' relatives holding vigil here Ã¢ € ” just as their shared plight unites them.After 69 days of shared fears and jitters Ã¢ € ” all of it under the close scrutiny of dozens of reporters that have now grown to a battalion Ã¢ € ” the early fellowship has frayed. Some relationships, once at least cordial, are as hostile as the desolate sands of the surrounding Acatama desert.""Here the tension is higher than down below. Down there they are calm,"" said Veronica Ticona, sister of 29-year-old Ariel Ticona, a trapped rubble-removal machine operator...Relatives privately shared stories of the divisiveness with an Associated Press reporter who spent the past month at the camp, frequently bedding down in a tent beside theirs, sharing coffee and gossip.The feuds and jealousies within families centered on such matters as who got to take part in weekend videoconferences with the miners, who received letters and why Ã¢ € ” or even who should speak to the media and how much they should be revealing about a family's interior life."
DISE	hpv/dysplasia	i have high risk hpv/herpes.    i had the leep done in feb this yr for precancerous cells that was shown on the copo done before the procedure.    after the leep, the tissue that was removed showed no dysplasia only inflammation.    i had a recheck pap and copo in june and that showed mild dysplasia.    so we just watched it and now in sept did a pap and copo and have moderate CIN2.    should i do the leep again?    does it pay to keep on doing the leep, than wait till the cells get worse, than do it again?    is this going to keep on occuring with the high risk hpv?    it doesnt seem to resolve and it seems like it just gets worse as we wait.    is this normal with this highrisk hpv, or does this not seem right? i am scared if we miss something it will turn into cancer.    does mine seem more agressive than others?Please give me yall input, it means alot!!!thanks
DISE	Narcotic and non-narcotic withdrawals	Hello! I am currently going thru a detox of Paxil, hydros, nicotine, and while I was at it I stopped the marijuana.I am a wreck!It's been about 10-13 days I've stopped the Paxil - I did so with the help of my doc from 40mg gradually down to 10. I am completely off the med currently. I started taking it approx 5 years agoIt's been about 3-4 days since I've stopped the hydros. I started those about the same time as the Paxil. Problem being off these is I NEED them for pain. There have been many times I was able to stop and I only take them when I need to, but I hate to be taking anything!And it's been the same 3-4 days since I've stopped the nicotine and the marijuana.You can imagine why I'm a wreck. I'm a mom to 3 very young kids and I'm doing everything I can to be clean.My real questions are this:1. How do I completely stop the narcotic pain meds if I actually have severe pain I need them for?2. How long is this horrible detox from Paxil gonna take? I have had some huge sensory problems as well as the regular anxiety and such.3. Why isn't there an easier way?!!!?!!!!That last one is rhetorical :-).Thank you in advance!

GOAL	Tooth sensitivity months after root canal	Hi: I had a root canal done in November on upper front molar.    I went back January 3rd for follow-up and told dentist my tooth was very sensitive still.    Went back again on January 17th, and they re-cleaned everything out and found a 4th canal.    At this time, they temporarily attached my new crown.    It is now January 31st, and my tooth feels no better than it did in November.    It is not sensitive to hot and cold, but it is sensitive to touch (pressing my tongue on it), and it is definitely sensitive to chewing.    I am going back to the dentist in March, but I sure would like another person's thoughts about what is happening.    Thank you for your consideration.
DISE	emotional distress and gerd	I am a 37 y.o. woman who has GERD my whole life.    Recently, I had 2 bouts of severe gastritis, puked up yellow bile after a night of drinking (only a social drinker).    I have eliminated all coffee and soft drinks from my diet and now all alcohol.    My stomach burns so bad around the clock.    I take 1 protonix twice a day and supplement tums when needed.    If I eat, I immediately feel dizzy and bloated.    Once I take a tums, I release the gas and start burping up my food (refluxing).    I am wondering if my poor, hunched posture has something to do with it.    I also feel tired all day long.    Does emotional stress make GERD worse too?    My husband gets mad at me whenever I talk about feeling sick, which causes more stress on me.    I can't win and don't think I'll ever be able to be well again.
TRMT	Bleeding 11 years after partial hysterectomy	Two days ago my lower back started hurting & I had a brownish discharge from my vagina. I had a partial hysterectomy 11 years ago because I had large fibroid tumors. My ovaries and cervix    were left. I just    went to family physician and    after a vaginal exam she said she has never seen a hysterectomy like mine. I t looks different (whatever that means) .I have to wait on the results of my pap smear and then I'm going back to surgeon that did my hysterectomy. Do you have a clue what might be wrong? I know it might be ovarian cancer. Right?
SOCL	What do I do now?	"So, recently my boyfriend has made me realize what a horrible girlfriend I am and now I'm questioning the stability of our relationship. We have been pretty rocky for the past month and I think it's all my fault. We were talking about why our relationship seems like its going downhill and he goes ""when was the last time you initiated a makeout session?"" It really made me think. Its true. I am rarely ever the one to initiate any intimacy. I don't know if its me being too shy or self-conscious to initiate anything or if maybe subconsciously I'm not really into him. I feel really bad about this because this is the one thing that I knew would ruin our relationship: My super-low self confidence. If I were more confident I think it would be easier for me to come on to him, but since I always feel ugly or overweight, I never seen to gain the courage to do anything. But when he comes on to me I'm really excited about that because its like ""Oh yay, he's still into me, phew."" But now I'm thinking I can't leave all the work to him. I asked him what I could do and at this point he said ""I'm so over sex right now because I feel like I have to do all the work and now I'm not even in the mood."" So this made me feel really bad because I never thought it would get this bad. Some guys like to be the one in control, but I guess he doesn't. I would like to work up the courage to be more in control too, but I don't even know where to start now. I feel really discouraged. Anyone else ever had this problem? I would love any advice. Thank you."

FAML	4 year old fits.	My son is 4 years old and recently I had him tested for ADHD. The Doctor said that he observed no ADHD tendencies but that he is extremely intelligent for his age. He added that my son is processing at the level of a 6-8 yr old verbally and 4-6 yr old non verbally.The problem we are having is that our son has these terrible tantrums when he does not get his way. He usually hits himself in the head when he is mad and has been known to throw things. He screams when his shows are turned off or he is made to eat. (it is impossible to get him to eat)Otherwise, he is a loving little boy and very sweet most of the time. He is just extremely defiant and is constantly challenging myself and my husband.Any ideas?

We agreed to have unprotected sex with each other frequently. I am sure she doesnt sleep with anyone without protection except me.

TRMT	Bag problems	My mum has had a bag for a few months now, and she's just started chemotherapy about 3 months ago. Whenever she goes through a treatment the wounds around the stoma open. Often it becomes quiet large and it bleeds a little bit, she is also on a blood thinner. I've taken to taping the bag down so the edges seal, but we're at our wits end.Any ideas on healing the wound or at least keeping the bag down so nothing leaks?Also, she has been having an acid like discharge, would this be the cause of citrus fruits, etc?

PREG	TRY AND TRY AGAIN &amp; SHOULD I HAVE HAD FOLLOW UP TESTING? COULD IT BE TOO LATE?	WHAT IN THE WORLD SHOULD I DO???My Husband and I had a miscarriage over a year ago or so...and, right after I had my miscarriage was confirmed by a doctor through a blood test. When the nurse called me back to double confirm that I was indeed having a miscarriage, I asked her if I would have to go back in to get checked out, or have some follow up testing done or SOMETHING....but she said I didn't have to go back ever again if I didn't want to...or something like that..you know, basically just to reassure me that I didn't need to go back because I was supposedly fine. The only thing she did tell me to do was to hold off on trying to make a baby for at least 3 to 4 months or so that my body could fully recover. The reason why I am asking if I should still have follow up testing...(even though it's almost two years since the miscarriage)...is because, my husband and I have been trying ever since Father's Day of 2010 to make a baby...and now it's already January 4th 2011...and we still aren't pregnant. It's just been a little discouraging. My other questions are, what are the specific, and best days to conceive each month? How can I tell if I'm ovulating (without a ovulation predictor kit)? Is it possible that I am no longer able to conceive? Did the nurse make a mistake by telling me not to come back for a check up or follow up? Have I not fully recovered? Is there something wrong with me due to the miscarriage and the effects it had on my body? Is it possible to not ever conceive again after a miscarriage? I have heard so many things...I am confused. It is just concerning me that it is taking so long to get pregnant. The first time was really easy. My Husband and I had tried for about 4 months...and then we got pregnant. It all went by so fast...and it seemed effortless. Now it seems like such a struggle for us to conceive. What should I do?--ksh09
GOAL	Sunday Weigh In	Well, another week has gone and it's time to see where we are all at.I am sorry to say that I'm up 2 lbs this week.A few weeks ago, my pcp freaked out at my thyroid levels and insisted on decreasing my med dosage, even though I begged him not to do it. I stayed on my old dosage until I ran out of it and it only took a couple of weeks on the new, lower dose to mess me up completely.    I did see my endo, on Friday and when I explained to him what had happened, he increased my dosage to where it should be and I'm hopeful that it won't take long to get back to where I was.In the meantime, I'm on Christmas break for the next 2 weeks and I see no reason why I can't hit the exercise mat on a daily basis to at least keep from going up any more and hopefully to drop some weight.Okay -- now it's YOUR turn.............

FAML	My 11 Year Old Step son Poops his pants	My 11 year old step son still poops his pants.    My husband and I got custody of my son when he was 5 years old.    His mother and us lived in diffrent states. She was not a good mother so we were able to get custody.    When we got him he was never fully potty trained.    He would have accidents but we would say he is young that is okay.    The whole 6 years we had him his mother would barely call or see him.    She would only see him in the summer.    He would have problems pooping his pants in school and it would fall on the floor and the teachers would call me after they found the poop on the floor.    He would not do it everyday but he would do it enough.    Then bout 9 months ago we moved to the same state his mom lives in.    He has been seeing her everyother weekend.    Since we moved here he does it everyday.    We have tried everything from making him wash them out, spanking him, embarrassing him, talking to him and taking all his toys away. Nothing has worked.    I had doctor's tell me nothing is wrong.    I had counslers tell me to ignore it.    We have tried all that.    He smells so bad when he does it that my 6 and 7 year old children tell him he smells.    He said that he cannot feel it and it does not bother him if he is messy and smells.    Then after he does all that he does not feel the need to shower.    My son is also ADHD.    But I have a daughter that is to and she does not poop her pants. He also trys to hide it by putting the underware in hiding spots in his room. The next thing you know the house is smelly because of it.    He gets in the vehicle when the family goes somewhere and it is almost unbearable to sit in the van with him.    I feel sorry for the other kids because they have to sit back there with him.    I have asked everybody I know for help and all the ideas have been used. Can anybody help!!!!

DISE	lamactil	"Ok!    So every time I feel like I may be balancing out with my moods, I have to upgrade my dosage.    The first time I increased, I was manic for a week then crashed.    The second upgrade I was already down and got more down.    I am just starting to come back up and feel ok, to only increase again tomorrow.    I am really nervous about what will happen and how I will be.    During my second upgrade, my rage was out of control.    I had never felt that way before with such passion.    I am definetly seeing some positive things on this medication, like the voices have stopped and I can actually get out of bed.    I don't cry and I actually can shower and go to work.    But I am unsure what normal actually feels like and therefore have no way of knowing if this is as good as it gets.    Then of course, I think of my manic days and I want them back.    I want my energy.    I am reading the book, ""I'm not crazy just bipolar""    it is an awesome autobiography.    She really explained how I feel depressed and manic in my own words.    Amazing.    I am trying to get all the information I can and read all the time.    I check on here all the time and then I feel like I am getting obsessed.    I just feel like there is a glimmer of hope in getting better, but it is always just out of reach.    I can remember crying at the age of twelve because I was so depressed I wanted to die.    I remember having panic attacks and breakdowns and no one able to help me or understand.    I was afraid of everything and struggled with depression.    I lost friends and jobs and family.    I then turned seriously mainc during college.    Experimenting with men and drugs to ease the pain.    For once I was not sad.    This lasted for a long time and I have been living this rollercoaster for too long.    I just want to get off.    Why did it take so long for anyone to notice what was wrong with me?    why did noone help?    I have so many questions and just want to be happy with going to work and coming home and being ""normal""    I don't want to stress about the unorganized closet or the cupboards that need painting and reorganizing.    I don't want to count and recount my money to be sure there is enough or stay awake wondering how I will get everything done if I keep sleeping.    Then I want no fog and I want to feel - being numb *****!"

PREG	Advice Please :(	I have had morning sickness for about a week or more starting last Sunday. Everyday it has been extremely bad to where I get sick 3 or 4 times a day, and have trouble keeping anything down.    However yesterday, even though I felt really sick, never got sick and was able to actually eat. This was the first time since Sunday I was actually able to eat a meal.

This morning when I woke up I got sick., This is my first experience and was just wanting some information....Does everything seem normal?
DISE	swollen, red tonsils, 2 weeks, Z-pac not working, no white pockets....what is it??	I am 26 years old. Almost 2 weeks ago I developed a sore throat, swollen tonsils (but no puss or pockets or fever) and slightly swollen lymph nodes under my jaw. I went to the clinic, took a strep test and it was negative. I was told it was either from the post nasal drip from my allergies or viral. She told me that if my sore throat didn't get any better by the 7th day from the first day of sympoms to take z-pac that she prescribed. The next day I woke up with all of the symptoms of a cold, runny nose, sneezing, cough but still no fever or puss pockets in my throat. that lasted for about 5 days.    by that time the cold was almost gone and the sore throat was gone but my tonsils were still swollen. I finished the 5 day z-pac yesterday (which would be the 13th day since symptoms appeared) but my tonsils are STILL swollen and red. My throat no longer hurts and the Lymph nodes under my jaw are almost back to normal. There are no pus pockets or yellow suff on my tonsils. They are just red and swollen and a little painful. I have allergies and take Claranix-D daily. Can swollen tonsils be due to allergies? The only times I have ever had swollen tonsils is when I had strep years ago. If it was bacterial shouldn't it be almost gone by now from the meds?
DISE	Biopsy or excision?	I have recently been diagnosed with a abnormal breast lump.    I've had an ultrasound already, and am supposed to get a mammogram next.    The doctor said that the I can either get a biopsy, or have the lump/tumor removed altogether in surgery.    He said that the needle that they would use for the biopsy would be very large in order to get enough tissue to examine, and that it would be extremely painful.    However, I don't know if immediately going into surgery is a good option either.    I received a BIRAD 4a result after the ultrasound.    I am wondering if anyone can help me decide which option would be better for me.    A painful biopsy, or having the entire lump removed to be tested?

FAML	5 year old running things	i just recently moved in with my girlfriend who's daughter is 5 (i have no kids) - the little girl is basically running things around the house and mom gives in to everything the girl wants, eventually. ive talked to my gf about it and we've come to the conclusion that something must be done. every morning there is a fight about brushing teeth, and what clothes she will and wont wear (she tells mom to pick it out, then says no shes not wearing it, pick out something else and so on and so forth), do my hair like yours, no thats not good enough..etc. -    but at night is the biggest problem, mom has allowed, thus far, the little girl to lay on the couch every night and watch tv until she falls asleep, then mom carries her to her room and puts her down, every night the little girl wakes up and crawls in bed with us (she seems too old, to me at least, for this behavior). i sat the little girl down and talked to her, told her we were setting some new rules and have set up a chores and reward program and also given her some big kid responsibility to make her own breakfast and pick out her own clothes. the girl responds to me quite well and does what i ask of her except when mom gets around, but thats another issue altogether. so big new rule was we were going to act like a big girl and sleep in her own bed, no tv - instead reading a book, and if she woke up in the middle of the night, at first, she could come in the room with us (just to ween her off of it slowly) but at least start off in her room. it started off wonderfully, mom read her a story then i laid in there and talked to her until she fell asleep - then 1:30am wake up call... horrible.. she throws a huge fit, blood curtling screams and nonstop crying,    because she wants to watch tv, we say no and stick to it (but of course mom wants us to just turn on the tv to shut her up).. the fit lasts about 30min, then she wants an oreo, then she wants her daddy, then back to the tv, this fit, still screaming and crying and now running from us around the house and trying to turn on the tv set, lasts another 30 min.. then when finally realizing she is not getting her way, a new game begins, now her eyes hurt and she cant sleep and now she needs medicine cause her leg hurts and now she needs a damp rag for her eyes, no not that towel a different towel, now you didnt wet it enough, now shes thirsty, now she doesnt want the towel, now she does want the towel, get a different towel, now she wants to sleep in moms bed. i wanted to put her in her room and let her cry it out, but im apparently heartless, mom gives in to the new game being played now.. no longer the tv fight, its now the power struggle to get her way (at least in my eyes), and the kid just won it again.. please help me before mom loses faith in my ideas for better behavior (it was hard enough to even talk to her about it seeing as its not my kid) and before i go insane.
