I am confused.  is there a definitive test for petusses in adults? Dr said I will be fine. Gave me ADVAIR and cough medicine and says I will be fine but will cough for a pretty long while until the lungs are clear.  He said I do not need antibiotics because I have already had zpack and 10 days of ampicillin, and then 3 days fo intravenous antibiotics. Who do I believe? I am 65 years old. never was feeling this sick or tired before or have had any kind of lung involvement in my life.  I am a strong healthy woman. No immune deficiency or anything like that.
